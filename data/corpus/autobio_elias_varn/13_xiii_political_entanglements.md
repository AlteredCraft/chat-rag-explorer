# XIII - POLITICAL ENTANGLEMENTS

The success of the Northern Railway drew me, whether I wished it or not, into the political life of Thornwick and the Federation. Those who build the means of power inevitably become entangled in the exercise of power, and my prominence as an engineer made it impossible to remain entirely outside the controversies that consumed our public discourse.

My formal entry into politics came in Tenthmonth of 1787, when the citizens of Millward Ward elected me to serve on the Thornwick Council. The Council of Twelve, as it was known, governed the city's affairs, setting taxes, allocating expenditures, regulating commerce, and representing Thornwick's interests in Federation matters. Membership was considered an honor and a responsibility, though the stipend was insufficient to compensate for the time the position required.

I had not sought election and was initially reluctant to accept when nominated. My work at the Foundry and the Academy (which I was then establishing) consumed most of my waking hours, and I doubted my ability to add political responsibilities without neglecting something important. Helena encouraged me to accept, arguing that the skills I had developed in managing large projects would serve the city well, and that refusing would appear ungrateful for the opportunities Thornwick had provided.

The Council I joined was divided between progressive and conservative factions, each claiming roughly equal numbers. The progressives, with whom I was naturally aligned, supported industrial development, guild reform, and investment in infrastructure and education. The conservatives, led by Alderman Jasper Stokes, sought to preserve traditional structures, protect established interests, and limit the changes that industrialization was bringing to Thornwick's society.

Stokes was a wealthy merchant who had inherited his position rather than earned it, and who viewed engineers and manufacturers with barely concealed disdain. He regarded industry as a necessary evil, productive of wealth but corrosive of social order. The workers displaced by machines, in his view, would become a restless population threatening property and stability. Better to slow the pace of change, to preserve the guild restrictions that limited competition, to maintain the hierarchies that kept each person in their proper place.

My first significant clash with Stokes came over the charter for the Mechanists' Guild, a new organization intended to represent the engineers and mechanics who had emerged as a distinct profession separate from traditional craft guilds. The Clockmakers' Guild and other established bodies opposed the new charter, fearing competition for members and influence. Stokes supported their opposition, arguing that the proliferation of guilds would fragment the crafts and undermine quality standards.

I spoke in favor of the charter at the Council meeting of Thirdmonth 1788, making what I believed was a straightforward case. The mechanical trades had developed specialized knowledge that existing guilds could not accommodate. Workers in these trades deserved the same representation and protection that traditional craftsmen enjoyed. Preventing them from organizing would merely drive them into informal associations beyond public oversight.

Stokes responded with a speech that I found infuriating in its condescension. He questioned whether mechanics truly constituted a distinct profession, suggested that their work was merely a variant of metalworking or carpentry, and implied that the charter petition was motivated by my personal ambition to dominate the new organization. He concluded by warning that the Council should beware of engineers who sought political power to complement their economic power.

The vote was close—eight in favor, four opposed—but the charter passed, establishing the Mechanists' Guild with the same status and privileges as older organizations. Stokes accepted the defeat with poor grace, and our relationship, never warm, became openly hostile thereafter.

Over the following years, I found myself engaged in numerous political battles that I would not have chosen but could not avoid. Guild reform, industrial safety regulation, education funding, trade policy—on each of these issues, my technical expertise and public standing made me a natural participant in debates that I might have preferred to leave to others.

The most consequential of these debates concerned the trade disputes that emerged between Thornwick and Hartwell in the late 1780s. The success of the Northern Railway had intensified commercial competition between the two cities, as goods could now move quickly in either direction. Hartwell's manufacturers sought protective tariffs that would disadvantage Thornwick products, while Thornwick's industrialists demanded reciprocal measures or open commerce on equal terms.

I advocated consistently for free trade, believing that competition would benefit consumers and stimulate innovation on both sides. Protection, I argued, merely preserved inefficiency and raised prices for everyone. Let each city specialize in what it did best, and let commerce flow freely between them. This position aligned with my economic interests—Thornwick's manufacturers were generally more efficient than Hartwell's—but I believed it was also correct in principle.

Edmund Blackwood, my old rival, led the protectionist faction in Hartwell, advocating for tariffs that would shield his city's industries from competition. The debate was conducted through pamphlets, public addresses, and lobbying of Federation Council members, a war of words that would eventually escalate into something more serious.

The formal break came in Tenthmonth of 1793, when Hartwell imposed tariffs on manufactured goods entering from Thornwick, in violation of Federation trade agreements. Thornwick retaliated with equivalent measures. Negotiations failed, positions hardened, and by the winter of 1793-94, commercial relations between the two cities had effectively ceased.

What followed was not quite war in the conventional sense—there was no declaration, no formal mobilization of armies—but it was more than mere commercial dispute. Hartwell privateers seized Thornwick merchant vessels on the coastal routes. Thornwick agents disrupted Hartwell's supply chains through the interior. Each city accused the other of violating Federation law, and each demanded that the Federation Council intervene on its behalf.

My involvement in these events was reluctant but substantial. As the designer of many of Thornwick's industrial facilities and the architect of the railway that connected us to the broader Federation, I possessed knowledge that proved militarily relevant when the conflict turned violent. The Council requested my assistance in preparing defenses against potential Hartwell aggression, and I could not in conscience refuse.

This period—the years from 1793 through 1796—was among the most difficult of my career. I shall describe the military aspects in a subsequent chapter, but here I wish to note the political dimensions that shaped my actions. I was torn between competing loyalties: to my city, which I wished to see defended; to the Federation, whose unity I valued; and to the principles of peaceful commerce and collaboration that had guided my professional life.

I argued consistently, in Council meetings and in private conversations, for negotiated settlement. The economic damage of the conflict far exceeded any benefit either side might gain from victory. Trade that enriched both cities had been replaced by hostility that impoverished both. And the military measures we were taking risked escalation into full-scale warfare that neither side could afford.

Alderman Stokes, to my surprise, proved an ally in advocating for peace. His conservatism, which I had often opposed, included skepticism about military adventures that disrupted established patterns and threatened unpredictable consequences. We found ourselves voting together on resolutions calling for negotiation, though we never resolved our other differences.

The conflict ended with the Treaty of Keswick in Ninthmonth of 1796, negotiated by Federation mediators who threatened to expel both cities from the Federation if they could not reach agreement. The treaty restored pre-conflict trade arrangements, provided for mutual compensation of seized property, and established procedures for resolving future disputes without resort to force.

I retired from the Council in Secondmonth of 1798, declining to stand for re-election after ten years of service. The political work had consumed more of my energy than I could sustain while also pursuing my technical projects, and younger men were available who could carry forward the work I had begun. The Mechanists' Guild was established and thriving. The Academy of Practical Sciences was entering its second decade. The immediate crisis with Hartwell had been resolved. It seemed an appropriate moment to step back.

Looking back on my political career, I am struck by how much I accomplished and how much remained undone. The reforms I advocated—guild modernization, safety regulation, educational investment—were partially achieved, but implementation remained incomplete and enforcement inconsistent. The principles I argued for—open commerce, rational policy, investment in productive capacity—gained adherents but also provoked opposition that limited their application.

Perhaps the most important lesson I drew from political engagement was the recognition that technical solutions are never sufficient for social problems. The mechanisms I designed could be optimized, their performance measured, their defects corrected through systematic engineering. Political problems resisted such optimization: interests conflicted, values clashed, and the "correct" answer depended upon whose perspective one adopted.

This recognition did not diminish my commitment to technical work, but it altered my understanding of what that work could accomplish. Machines could increase productivity, but they could not ensure that productivity's benefits would be justly distributed. Railways could connect cities, but they could not prevent the conflicts that arose from commercial rivalry. Steam power could transform industry, but it could not transform the human nature that directed industry toward various ends.

I remained, and remain, convinced that technical progress is necessary for human welfare—that the material improvements industrialization has brought are genuine and valuable. But I became, through political experience, more modest about what technology alone could achieve. The good society requires not only efficient machines but also just institutions, wise policies, and citizens capable of balancing their individual interests against the common good. These requirements exceed what any engineer can provide, however skilled.

My political engagements taught me humility, in other words, and perhaps that was their most valuable lesson. I entered the Council believing that technical competence could be translated directly into political effectiveness. I left knowing that politics has its own requirements, its own expertise, its own forms of wisdom that engineers do well to respect even when they cannot fully master them.
