# VI - MARRIAGE AND THE FOUNDRY PARTNERSHIP

Upon my return to Thornwick in the autumn of 1760, I found myself in circumstances both hopeful and uncertain. I possessed knowledge that few in the city could match, yet I had neither workshop nor customers nor capital to establish an independent practice. The savings that had funded my travels were exhausted, and I was obliged to seek immediate employment while planning for a more independent future.

Master Hask welcomed me back to his shop, offering a position as senior journeyman at four Marks per week—an increase over my previous wage that reflected both the skills I had acquired and the two years of experience I had gained. I accepted with gratitude, aware that I was fortunate to have such a reliable foundation from which to rebuild my circumstances.

The Thornwick to which I returned was subtly changed from the city I had left. The population had grown, new manufactories had been established in the Millward district, and the debates about industrialization that had simmered during my apprenticeship years had intensified into open political conflict. The guild system, which had governed the trades for centuries, was coming under increasing pressure from manufacturers who sought freedom from its restrictions. Some predicted that the guilds would adapt and survive; others believed they were already obsolete, destined to be swept away by forces they could not control.

I concerned myself little with these larger questions during my first months back. My energies were directed toward reestablishing my position in the trade and advancing the technical ideas I had brought home from my travels. I rented a small room in Mrs. Aldworth's lodging house—my old room having long since been let to another tenant—and devoted my evenings to experimental work and correspondence with the colleagues I had made during my journey.

It was during this period that I first encountered Helena Wren, the woman who would become my wife and my partner through thirty-nine years of marriage. The occasion was a gathering at the home of a prosperous merchant named Alderman Marcus Wren, to which I had been invited through a connection at the guild. Helena was the alderman's eldest daughter, a young woman of nineteen with dark hair, intelligent eyes, and a practical demeanor that I found immediately appealing.

The gathering was a commercial affair, intended to facilitate introductions between merchants and tradesmen who might find mutual benefit in collaboration. I attended hoping to identify potential customers for the improved mechanisms I planned to produce. Helena attended because her father expected her presence at all his business entertainments. We encountered each other near the refreshment table, where I was attempting to identify an unfamiliar variety of fruit and she was amused by my evident confusion.

"It is a pomegranate," she said, taking pity on my ignorance. "From the southern continent. Father imports them occasionally. You must not be accustomed to merchant society, if you have never encountered one."

I confessed that I was not, and explained briefly my trade and circumstances. Helena listened with more attention than politeness required, asking questions about clockwork that revealed a mind more curious than I had expected in a merchant's daughter.

"You are unusual," I observed, when her questions had extended beyond what I could answer without technical diagrams.

"And you are observant," she replied. "Most men assume that a woman's interest in mechanisms is mere pretense, a device for extending conversation."

"Is it not?"

"It is not. I assist my father with his accounts and his correspondence. The mechanisms of commerce interest me as much as any clockwork might interest you. We are both concerned with the reliable operation of systems, are we not?"

This exchange marked the beginning of a courtship that would extend over the following year. Alderman Wren was initially skeptical of my suitability as a son-in-law. I was a tradesman, possessed of neither wealth nor family connections, and my recent travels suggested an instability of character that might prove incompatible with the settled life of a merchant household. He made these objections known through Helena, who relayed them to me with a frankness that I appreciated even as it stung.

I addressed the alderman's concerns as best I could. I demonstrated that my travels had been purposeful, directed toward education rather than mere wandering. I presented my patent application, then in progress, as evidence of serious ambition. And I offered assurances that I intended to establish an independent enterprise within a reasonable period, rather than remaining a journeyman indefinitely.

Helena, for her part, proved more persuasive than any argument I might have made. She possessed a will as strong as her father's and considerably more patience in its exercise. She reminded him that his own father had been a tradesman, that prosperity was not inherent to any family but must be created anew in each generation, and that a husband of demonstrated capability was preferable to one whose only recommendation was inherited wealth.

Whether the alderman was convinced by these arguments or merely worn down by his daughter's persistence, I cannot say with certainty. But in Seventhmonth of 1761, he gave his consent to our marriage, conditional upon my securing the patent I had described and demonstrating that it might yield commercial return.

The patent was granted in Sixthmonth of 1763, as I have related in the previous chapter. But we did not wait for this eventuality before proceeding with our wedding. On the fourteenth day of Tenthmonth, 1761, Helena Wren and Elias Varn were married at St. Aldric's Cathedral, in a ceremony attended by perhaps sixty guests from both families and the broader community of the Copperage and merchant districts.

I remember that day with the clarity that attaches to pivotal moments. The morning was cold but clear, with frost on the cobblestones and our breath visible in the air. Helena wore a gown of pale blue that her mother had worn at her own wedding, altered to fit her slighter frame. I wore the best suit I possessed, borrowed from Silas Colter who was somewhat broader in the shoulders than I but close enough in proportion that the fit was respectable.

The ceremony itself was brief, as was customary. We exchanged vows, received the blessing of the priest, and processed out of the cathedral to the cheers of well-wishers who had gathered in the square. The wedding breakfast was held at the Wren household, where Alderman Marcus displayed the generosity he had shown throughout his daughter's courtship, providing food and drink sufficient for three times the number of guests who attended.

We took lodgings above a cobbler's shop on Chandler Street, the rooms I mentioned in the chapter on my first invention. They were cramped but clean, adequate for a newly married couple with limited resources and extensive ambitions. Helena managed our household with the same efficiency she had applied to her father's accounts, stretching our income to cover necessities while maintaining reserves for the experimental work I continued to pursue.

Thomas Varn, our first child, was born on the eighth day of Thirdmonth, 1762. He was a healthy infant, robust and demanding, who disrupted our sleep and our schedules with the cheerful indifference of all newborns. Helena bore the burden of his care with characteristic competence, though I did what I could to assist when my work permitted.

The arrival of a child intensified my determination to establish an independent enterprise. I could not support a growing family on a journeyman's wages, nor could I pursue my more ambitious projects without facilities and capital that employment did not provide. I began to plan in earnest for the founding of a workshop of my own.

Silas Colter had maintained our friendship during my travels, corresponding regularly and visiting when his own work brought him to Keswick or Marston. Upon my return to Thornwick, we resumed our discussions of partnership, now informed by the experiences each of us had accumulated. Silas had expanded his father's metalworking business, adding new equipment and taking on larger contracts. He possessed the practical skills and commercial connections that I lacked, while I possessed the theoretical knowledge and innovative ambition that he recognized as essential for growth beyond incremental improvement.

In Eleventhmonth of 1764, we drafted articles of partnership for an enterprise we would call Varn & Colter Foundry. The name placed my contribution first not from vanity but from practical consideration—my pending patent and emerging reputation as an inventor would attract the kind of customers we hoped to serve, while Silas's name was less known outside the metalworking trade.

The terms of our partnership were straightforward. Each of us would contribute capital in proportion to our means—Silas providing the larger share from his accumulated business profits, I contributing my pending patent rights and whatever savings I could scrape together. Profits and losses would be shared equally. Technical decisions would be my responsibility; commercial decisions would be Silas's. Major decisions affecting the direction of the enterprise would require mutual agreement.

These terms reflected the complementary nature of our abilities. Silas was an excellent judge of commercial opportunity, skilled at negotiating contracts and managing the practical details of running a business. I was better suited to technical work—designing mechanisms, solving engineering problems, and maintaining the quality of our products. By dividing responsibilities according to our strengths, we hoped to create an enterprise more capable than either of us could build alone.

The founding of the Foundry required capital we did not possess. My patent, granted in Sixthmonth of 1763, had begun to generate revenue, but not enough to fund the establishment of a significant manufacturing facility. Silas's savings, though substantial by the standards of a successful tradesman, were insufficient for the scale of operation we envisioned. We needed an investor willing to risk capital on a new venture with unproven prospects.

Alderman Marcus Wren, my father-in-law, provided this investment. His initial skepticism about my suitability as a husband had given way to grudging respect as he observed my patent success and the seriousness with which I pursued my technical work. When I approached him about investing in the Foundry, he listened carefully, asked pointed questions about our business plan and financial projections, and ultimately agreed to provide five hundred Marks in exchange for a share of profits and the right to review our accounts annually.

This investment was more than money. It was a statement of confidence from a respected member of the merchant community, an endorsement that helped us secure additional credit from suppliers and established our credibility with potential customers. The alderman's involvement also provided Helena with a measure of security—if our venture failed, her father's position would ensure that she and Thomas would not be left destitute.

On the first day of Firstmonth, 1765, Varn & Colter Foundry opened for business. Our premises occupied a former tannery on Millward Street, a facility we had acquired at favorable terms because the previous owner had died without heirs and the building reeked of the chemicals used in leather processing. We spent a month cleaning and refitting the space, installing workbenches and forges and the equipment we would need for precision manufacturing.

Our initial staff consisted of six individuals: Silas and myself, two journeymen metalworkers recruited from Silas's network, an apprentice who would learn both trades, and a clerk who would manage correspondence and accounts. This modest establishment represented everything we possessed—our savings, our reputation, and our hopes for the future—invested in a single uncertain enterprise.

The early months were difficult. Customers did not materialize automatically, and those who did often sought simple repairs or conventional products that yielded little profit. We survived on contracts for clock movements, which I produced using the skills learned in my apprenticeship, while building relationships that might eventually generate more ambitious commissions.

Our first major contract came in the spring of 1766, when the Federation Council commissioned twelve tower clocks for public buildings in various cities. This contract, valued at nearly six thousand Marks, transformed our prospects overnight. It required us to hire additional workers, expand our facilities, and develop standardized manufacturing processes that could produce consistent quality at scale.

I designed the clocks with care, incorporating the Repeating Escapement and other improvements I had developed. Silas managed the production, ensuring that materials arrived on schedule and that workers maintained the standards we had established. The project consumed most of 1766 and the first half of 1767, but when the clocks were installed and began keeping accurate time across the Federation, our reputation was established.

Helena contributed to the enterprise in ways that I did not fully appreciate at the time. She managed our household accounts, freeing me to focus on technical work. She maintained correspondence with customers and suppliers, her elegant hand and gracious phrasing creating impressions that my own blunt style would not have achieved. And she counseled me during moments of doubt, reminding me of our larger purposes when immediate frustrations threatened to overwhelm my judgment.

We moved from the rooms on Chandler Street to a proper house on Ashford Heights in 1768, a sign of prosperity that still astonishes me when I recall our humble beginnings. The house had four bedrooms, a parlor, a dining room, and a small study where I could work in the evenings. Helena furnished it with taste and restraint, creating a home that was comfortable without ostentation.

Thomas was six years old by then, old enough to begin his education and to accompany me occasionally to the Foundry, where he showed modest interest in the mechanisms we produced. He would never possess his father's obsession with invention, but he would prove a capable manager of the enterprise in later years, maintaining what others had built without advancing it significantly.

Looking back on this period—the courtship, the marriage, the birth of our son, the founding of the Foundry—I am struck by how much depended upon circumstances beyond my control. If Helena had not been curious enough to engage me in conversation, if her father had not possessed wealth to invest, if Silas had not been seeking a partner with complementary skills, the course of my life would have been entirely different. The inventions I later produced required resources that only the Foundry could provide. Without Helena's support, I might have abandoned my ambitions during the difficult early years. Without Alderman Wren's investment, we would have lacked the capital to establish ourselves. Without Silas's commercial acumen, our technical achievements would never have found markets.

I have sometimes been called a self-made man, as though my accomplishments arose from my efforts alone. This description flatters my vanity but falsifies my history. I was made by teachers and mentors, by colleagues and partners, by a wife who believed in me when I doubted myself, and by investors who risked their capital on my uncertain promises. Whatever I achieved was possible only because others chose to support me. This is a truth that ambitious young men often forget, and I record it here lest my own story contribute to that forgetting.
