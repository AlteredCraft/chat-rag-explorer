# VII - THE THORNWICK STEAM COLLECTIVE

The success of Varn & Colter Foundry in its early years brought me into contact with an expanding circle of individuals who shared my interest in mechanical innovation. Some were craftsmen from related trades—metalworkers, millwrights, instrument makers—who sought to improve the methods of their professions. Others were natural philosophers who had observed developments in steam power and wished to understand their principles more fully. Still others were merchants and manufacturers who sensed commercial opportunities in new technologies and sought the expertise to exploit them.

These diverse individuals came together informally during the middle years of the 1760s, meeting at taverns and workshops to discuss their projects and exchange ideas. I participated in several such gatherings, finding in them a stimulation that the guild meetings could not provide. Where the guild looked backward, these informal assemblies looked forward, asking not what had been done but what might yet be accomplished.

The idea of formalizing these gatherings into a regular society arose in conversations with Jonas Petworth, a hydraulics specialist whom I had first met at the Southern Workshops during my travels and who had since relocated to Thornwick. Petworth was a quiet, methodical man, more interested in the flow of water than the flow of conversation, but he recognized that the informal gatherings suffered from inconsistency—participants came and went unpredictably, discussions had no continuity from one meeting to the next, and valuable ideas were often lost for lack of record or follow-up.

"We need a society," Petworth said during one of our meetings at the Brass Wheel tavern. "Something with regular meetings, consistent membership, and a commitment to practical outcomes. The natural philosophy societies discuss principles; we should discuss applications."

I agreed with this assessment, and over the following months, we developed a proposal for what would become the Thornwick Steam Collective. The name reflected our particular interest in steam power, which we believed would transform industry more fundamentally than any previous innovation. But the society's scope would extend to all forms of mechanical power and their applications.

On the fourteenth day of Tenthmonth, 1768—seven years to the day after my wedding—eight individuals gathered at the Brass Wheel to formally establish the Collective. The founding members were myself, Jonas Petworth, Silas Colter, Dr. Aldric Crane the younger (son of my professor at Dunmore, who had recently moved to Thornwick to pursue practical applications of his theoretical training), Dr. Marcus Fellows (a natural philosopher from the university), Edmund Gray (a successful mill owner), Peter Hallsworth (a manufacturer of pumping equipment), and William Chen (an instrument maker who had emigrated from the eastern continent).

We adopted simple rules of governance. Meetings would be held on the first and third Sixthday of each month, rotating among members' premises. Each member would present at least two papers per year, describing work in progress or problems encountered. Membership would be by invitation, with unanimous consent of existing members required for admission. Annual dues of two Marks would cover the costs of correspondence, publication, and a modest library.

The Collective's early meetings were marked by enthusiasm and optimism, perhaps excessive in retrospect. We believed that the systematic application of scientific principles to practical problems would yield rapid improvements in every area of industry. Steam engines would become more efficient, mechanisms more precise, manufacturing more productive. Within a generation, we thought, the character of work would be transformed.

Our optimism was not entirely misplaced, as subsequent events would demonstrate. But we underestimated the obstacles that lay between conception and implementation. The principles of steam power were well understood in theory; the difficulties arose in translation to practice. Materials failed under pressures that theory suggested they should withstand. Mechanisms that worked perfectly in demonstration proved unreliable in continuous operation. Craftsmen trained in traditional methods resisted new techniques that threatened their established skills.

I presented my first paper to the Collective in Eleventhmonth of 1768, describing the application of feedback principles to steam engine regulation. The concepts I outlined would eventually become the Varn Governor, but at that stage, they remained theoretical, supported by calculations but not yet tested in practice. The Collective's response was mixed—some members saw immediately the potential of the approach, while others questioned whether the complexity of a self-regulating system could be made reliable enough for industrial use.

Dr. Crane's contributions were particularly valuable during this period. He possessed the theoretical training that most of us lacked, able to translate our practical intuitions into mathematical formulations and to identify errors in our reasoning before we committed them to expensive experimentation. He and I developed a close collaboration, meeting regularly to discuss problems and review each other's work. This collaboration would eventually lead to his marriage to my daughter Margaret, though at the time neither of us anticipated such personal consequences from our professional relationship.

The Collective's first public demonstration took place in Fifthmonth of 1769. We had constructed a steam-powered hammer, capable of delivering blows far more powerful and consistent than any human smith could achieve. The device was designed by me, built at Varn & Colter Foundry, and powered by a small steam engine that Jonas Petworth had assembled from components available in Thornwick.

The demonstration was held in the Foundry's courtyard, before an audience of perhaps fifty individuals—guild members, merchants, city officials, and curious citizens who had heard rumors of our work. The hammer operated continuously for three hours, shaping iron bars into finished components with a speed and precision that astonished the observers. Guild Master Aldred Stone, who had criticized my earlier innovations, stood in evident discomfort as the machine accomplished in minutes what his best smiths required hours to achieve.

The demonstration succeeded in its immediate purpose of attracting attention to the Collective's work. Several manufacturers approached us afterward, inquiring about acquiring similar equipment for their own facilities. The city's newspapers published favorable accounts, praising the ingenuity of Thornwick's engineers and predicting a prosperous future for mechanical industry.

But the demonstration also provoked opposition that we had not anticipated. The smiths' guild objected strenuously to a machine that threatened their members' livelihoods. Conservative councilmen raised concerns about the social consequences of mechanization—what would become of the workers displaced by engines that never tired, never demanded wages, never organized to resist exploitation? Religious authorities questioned whether the harnessing of such power was consonant with divine intention, suggesting that humans might be overreaching proper limits in their pursuit of mechanical advantage.

These objections were not frivolous, though we sometimes dismissed them impatiently at the time. The concerns about worker displacement proved prescient—industrialization would indeed disrupt traditional patterns of employment, creating hardship for those unable to adapt to new requirements. The ethical questions about the proper use of power would recur throughout my career, particularly during the debates over military applications of steam technology.

Master Doran Hask attended the steam hammer demonstration, one of his last public appearances before his death in the Great Fire six years later. He congratulated me afterward with evident pride, though he confessed that he did not fully understand the principles by which the device operated.

"You have gone far beyond what I taught you," he said. "I formed you as a clockmaker, and you have become something else—something the trade has no name for yet. I do not know whether to be proud or apprehensive."

"Why apprehensive?" I asked.

"Because power without wisdom is dangerous," he replied. "You are accumulating power faster than wisdom grows. I trust your judgment, but I do not know if you can trust yourself. The temptation to apply what one can do, regardless of whether one should do it, is very strong. Be careful that your engines do not run faster than your conscience can regulate."

I have often recalled this warning in subsequent years, particularly during the debates about defensive technology that arose during the Hartwell conflict. Master Hask understood, more clearly than I did at the time, that technical capability creates moral responsibility. The engineer who makes new powers available must also accept some portion of the responsibility for how those powers are used. This is an uncomfortable truth that many of my colleagues prefer to evade, but I have tried to honor my master's warning by engaging with the ethical dimensions of my work rather than retreating into purely technical considerations.

The Collective continued to meet regularly through the early 1770s, producing papers, conducting experiments, and gradually building a body of practical knowledge about steam power and its applications. Our membership expanded to include perhaps twenty regular participants, with occasional visitors from other cities who heard of our work and sought to learn from or contribute to it.

We established a modest library, housed initially in a closet at the Brass Wheel and later in dedicated premises we rented on Mill Street. The library contained technical treatises, collections of patents, proceedings of scientific societies from across the Federation and beyond, and the growing archive of our own papers and correspondence. It became a resource for anyone in Thornwick interested in mechanical innovation, open to non-members during specified hours and maintained by a part-time librarian whom we funded from membership dues.

The Collective also served as an informal clearinghouse for technical talent. Members would refer skilled workers to each other, recommend solutions to problems they had encountered, and share intelligence about new developments elsewhere in the Federation. This network proved invaluable as our various enterprises grew and as the demand for skilled mechanical workers exceeded the supply available through traditional guild training.

Looking back on the Collective's early years, I am struck by both what we accomplished and what we failed to foresee. We succeeded in advancing the application of steam power to industrial purposes, developing techniques and equipment that transformed manufacturing in Thornwick and eventually throughout the Federation. We created an institutional framework for collaborative innovation that would evolve into the Academy of Practical Sciences some twenty years later.

But we failed to anticipate the social upheavals that industrialization would bring. We assumed too easily that progress would benefit all, that workers displaced by machines would find new employment in the factories that replaced their traditional crafts. We did not consider adequately the environmental consequences of burning coal at industrial scales, the pollution that would darken Thornwick's skies and foul its waters. We were engineers, focused on making things work, and we left to others—often to no one—the task of considering whether those things should work at all.

These failures do not diminish the genuine achievements of the Collective and its members. But they remind me that technical progress is not synonymous with human progress, and that those who create new capabilities bear some responsibility for their consequences. Master Hask's warning remains relevant, decades after his death: power without wisdom is dangerous. I hope that the institutions I have helped to build—the Collective, the Foundry, the Academy—will produce not only skilled engineers but wise ones, capable of considering the full implications of their work before committing it to practice.

The Collective still meets, though I have not attended regularly for many years. Its membership has turned over entirely since the founding—the original eight members are all dead now, save myself, and most of the second generation have passed as well. But the institution endures, adapting to new circumstances while preserving the core purpose we established in 1768: the practical application of scientific knowledge to problems of industry and society. Whatever legacy I leave, the Collective will be part of it, a model of collaborative innovation that I hope will long survive my individual contributions.
