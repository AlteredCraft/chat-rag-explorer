# XI - EXPERIMENTS WITH PRESSURE SYSTEMS

The years following the Great Fire witnessed an intensification of my work on steam power and its regulation. The disaster had demonstrated with terrible clarity the dangers of uncontrolled industrial processes, and I became convinced that safety must be central to any further development. The Varn Governor, which I patented in 1778, was the most significant outcome of this conviction, but the path to that invention required extensive experimentation and the painful accumulation of knowledge through failure.

The fundamental problem I sought to address was the instability of steam pressure in operating engines. A boiler generates steam through the application of heat to water, but the rate of steam generation varies with numerous factors: the intensity of the fire, the level of water in the boiler, the temperature of incoming feedwater, the rate at which steam is being consumed by the engine, and the efficiency of heat transfer through the boiler walls. These variables interact in complex ways, producing pressure fluctuations that can exceed the safe operating limits of the equipment.

When pressure rises too high, the consequences can be catastrophic. Boilers are essentially sealed vessels containing high-energy steam; if the vessel ruptures, the steam expands explosively, releasing energy comparable to a bomb. I had read accounts of boiler explosions that killed dozens of workers, destroyed entire buildings, and scattered debris over distances measured in hundreds of yards. Such disasters were not rare—they occurred several times per year across the Federation—and their frequency was increasing as steam power became more widely adopted.

The traditional safeguard against overpressure was the safety valve, a simple device that opened automatically when pressure exceeded a specified limit, venting steam to prevent rupture. Safety valves worked, in principle, but they were often inadequate in practice. Workers would sometimes disable or weight them to achieve higher operating pressures and greater engine output. The valves themselves could become stuck through corrosion or debris. And even when functioning properly, they provided only a binary response—closed below the limit, open above it—without the graduated regulation that efficient operation required.

My approach, developed over the three years following the fire, was to create a feedback mechanism that would continuously regulate steam generation to match steam consumption, maintaining stable pressure without the need for human intervention or the risks of emergency venting.

The theoretical foundation for this approach came from my earlier work on the Repeating Escapement and from the principles I had studied at Dunmore. Any regulated system requires three components: a sensor that measures the variable to be controlled, a comparator that determines whether the measurement differs from the desired value, and an actuator that adjusts the system to reduce any difference. In mechanical terms, this translates to a pressure gauge, a mechanism that responds to pressure deviation, and a valve or damper that controls steam generation.

The challenge lay in making these components work together reliably under the harsh conditions of industrial operation. The pressure sensor must withstand high temperatures and remain accurate despite vibration and contamination. The response mechanism must operate smoothly across a range of pressures, neither overshooting the desired value nor oscillating around it. And the control valve must handle the corrosive environment of steam and combustion products without deterioration.

I constructed my first experimental pressure regulator in early 1776, using the rebuilt Foundry as both laboratory and test facility. The device employed a simple diaphragm as a pressure sensor, connected through a lever system to a damper that controlled airflow to the boiler's furnace. When pressure rose, the diaphragm deflected, partially closing the damper and reducing the fire's intensity; when pressure fell, the damper opened, allowing more air and increasing combustion.

This first prototype demonstrated the basic principle but suffered from severe operational problems. The diaphragm was too sensitive to rapid pressure fluctuations, causing the damper to oscillate wildly rather than maintaining steady regulation. The lever system introduced friction and play that delayed response and reduced precision. And the damper itself proved inadequate to control the fire effectively, creating changes too small to matter or too large to stabilize.

I recorded these failures meticulously in my workshop journals, analyzing each problem and designing modifications to address it. The oscillation issue required damping—some mechanism to smooth rapid fluctuations while preserving response to genuine pressure changes. The friction problem required better bearings and more precise fabrication. The damper problem required fundamental redesign, replacing the airflow control with a more direct mechanism for regulating steam flow itself.

Over the following two years, I constructed and tested perhaps a dozen prototypes, each representing a step forward from the previous design. Jonas Petworth, my colleague from the Steam Collective, provided invaluable assistance with the hydraulic aspects of the design, suggesting modifications that improved stability and responsiveness. Dr. Aldric Crane contributed theoretical analysis, helping me understand why certain configurations oscillated while others remained stable.

The breakthrough came in the spring of 1778, when I replaced the diaphragm sensor with a centrifugal mechanism—a pair of weighted arms that spread apart as rotational speed increased, connected through linkages to the steam supply valve. The centrifugal governor, as I came to call it, derived its input not from pressure directly but from engine speed, which served as a reliable proxy for the balance between steam supply and steam consumption. When the engine ran too fast (indicating excess steam), the arms spread wider, throttling the steam supply; when it ran too slowly (indicating insufficient steam), the arms contracted, opening the valve.

This design offered several advantages over the diaphragm approach. The centrifugal mechanism was inherently damped by the inertia of the rotating arms, eliminating the oscillation problems that had plagued earlier prototypes. The rotational input could be taken from the engine's flywheel, providing a clean signal unaffected by the vibrations and pressure spikes that corrupted direct pressure measurement. And the mechanism was robust, constructed from solid metal components that could withstand the industrial environment without deterioration.

I patented the Varn Governor on the twenty-third day of Seventhmonth, 1778, receiving Thornwick Registry Patent Number 1,203. The patent described the centrifugal mechanism in detail, including the mathematical relationships that governed its behavior and the manufacturing specifications required for reliable operation. I intended the patent not merely to protect my commercial interests but to establish a standard that others could follow, ensuring consistent quality across the growing population of steam installations.

The first installation of the Governor was at the Thornwick Pressworks, where it replaced the manually operated throttle that had previously regulated steam to the printing machinery. The improvement was immediately apparent: the press operated more smoothly, with fewer variations in speed and pressure that had previously required constant operator attention. The workers, freed from the task of continuous adjustment, could focus on paper handling and quality control, improving both productivity and product quality.

Word of the Governor's effectiveness spread rapidly through the engineering community. Within a year of the patent's grant, I had received inquiries from manufacturers throughout the Federation seeking to license the technology or purchase pre-built units. I established a licensing program that permitted qualified installers to implement the design in exchange for a fee of fifty Marks per installation, plus ongoing royalties based on engine capacity. This arrangement generated significant revenue while encouraging broad adoption of the safety improvement.

By 1780, Governors had been installed on forty-five steam engines across the Federation, representing perhaps a quarter of the total installed base. The effect on safety was dramatic: boiler explosions declined by approximately ninety percent among regulated installations, a figure compiled by the Federation Council as part of an inquiry into industrial safety prompted by continued disasters at unregulated facilities.

The success of the Governor led naturally to advocacy for mandatory regulation. If the technology existed to prevent boiler explosions, should not its adoption be required rather than merely encouraged? I argued this position before the Thornwick Council and in pamphlets distributed throughout the Federation, urging legislative action to protect workers who could not protect themselves.

This advocacy proved controversial. Manufacturers objected to the cost of compliance, arguing that the decision to adopt safety equipment should rest with property owners rather than government. Philosophical opponents questioned whether the state had authority to mandate particular technologies, even for demonstrably beneficial purposes. And practical objections arose concerning enforcement—how could inspectors verify compliance across the hundreds of steam installations operating throughout the Federation?

These objections delayed but did not prevent action. The Federation Council, responding to public concern following a particularly deadly explosion in Hartwell that killed thirty-seven workers, adopted the Steam Safety Act of 1782, requiring pressure regulation on all new boiler installations and providing incentives for retrofitting existing equipment. The act specified the Varn Governor or equivalent technology as the required standard, effectively mandating my invention while permitting alternatives that could demonstrate equivalent effectiveness.

I take some satisfaction in this legislative achievement, though I recognize that many others contributed to its passage. The workers who died in preventable explosions were, in a sense, the most persuasive advocates—their deaths made arguments that no living person could have made as forcefully. The politicians who voted for the act, the inspectors who enforced it, the manufacturers who eventually accepted its requirements—all these played essential roles that my invention alone could not have fulfilled.

The Governor remains in widespread use today, essentially unchanged from the 1778 design. Later engineers have made refinements—improved bearings, more precise calibration, adaptation to higher pressures and larger engines—but the fundamental principle remains the one I described in my patent: centrifugal feedback control of steam supply to maintain stable operation. Each time I see a Governor spinning atop an engine, I recall the years of experimentation that preceded its development, the failures that taught me what would not work, and the colleagues who contributed insights that made success possible.

The development of the Governor also taught me something about the nature of invention that I had not previously understood. My earlier work—the Repeating Escapement, the Pressworks engine—had been motivated primarily by the desire to achieve a particular outcome, to solve a problem that interested me or promised commercial return. The Governor was different: it was motivated by the desire to prevent harm, to protect people from dangers they could not protect themselves against. This moral dimension gave the work a significance beyond its technical content, connecting my engineering efforts to broader purposes of human welfare.

I have tried to maintain this connection in subsequent work, asking not only whether an invention is possible but whether it is beneficial, not only how it can be implemented but what effects its implementation might have. These questions do not always yield clear answers, and I have sometimes proceeded with projects whose ultimate effects remained uncertain. But the habit of asking has shaped my career in ways that I believe have been positive, directing my energies toward applications that serve genuine needs rather than mere possibilities.
