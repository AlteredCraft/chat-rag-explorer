# X - THE GREAT FIRE AND RECONSTRUCTION

The Great Fire of Thornwick began on the fifteenth day of Tenthmonth, 1775, in a warehouse on the eastern edge of the Millward district. The cause was never definitively established, though subsequent investigation pointed to improperly stored chemicals that may have ignited spontaneously or been set alight by an unattended lamp. By the time the fire was detected and the alarm raised, the warehouse was fully engulfed, and the flames were spreading to neighboring structures.

I learned of the fire while at home on Ashford Heights, awakened by the sound of bells from St. Aldric's tower. The sky to the south was already glowing an unnatural orange, and a column of smoke rose above the rooftops, illuminated from below by the advancing flames. I dressed quickly and made my way toward the Millward district, joining the growing crowd of citizens converging on the disaster.

The scene that greeted me was beyond anything I had previously witnessed. The fire had spread with terrifying speed through the densely built industrial quarter, leaping from building to building across narrow streets and alleys. Bucket brigades formed spontaneously, but their efforts were pitifully inadequate against the conflagration. The city's fire engines—hand-operated pumps that had served well enough for ordinary fires—could not generate sufficient pressure to reach the upper stories of burning buildings or to combat flames that extended across entire blocks.

The Foundry stood in the path of the advancing fire. Silas Colter and I had established our enterprise in this district precisely because of its industrial character—the proximity to other manufactories, the access to water power, the tolerance for noise and smoke that residential areas would not have permitted. Now this location threatened our destruction.

I made my way to the Foundry, where I found Silas already organizing the removal of valuable equipment and documents. Our workers—those who had reached the premises—were carrying patterns, tools, and partially completed mechanisms to safety, depositing them in the street beyond the fire's apparent path. There was no time for systematic evacuation; we grabbed what we could reach and trusted that the most important items would be among them.

The fire reached the Foundry sometime after midnight. I watched from a distance as flames consumed the roof, then the upper floor, then the workshops where I had spent so many hours developing the mechanisms that had made my reputation. The heat was intense even at a hundred yards distance, and the sound of collapsing timbers created a continuous roar that drowned out all other noise.

We saved perhaps a quarter of the Foundry's contents. The heavy equipment—forges, presses, the steam engine that powered our machinery—was lost entirely, too massive to move and too valuable to abandon lightly. Our records were largely preserved, having been stored in iron cabinets that survived the heat long enough for the fire to pass. Many of our patterns and molds were recovered, though some were warped beyond use by the heat. The financial loss was substantial—later calculated at approximately two thousand Marks, not counting the cost of rebuilding—but it was survivable.

Others were less fortunate. One hundred twenty-seven people died in the Great Fire, most of them residents of the Narrows who were trapped in their homes before they could escape. The dead included Master Doran Hask, my mentor and friend, who perished in the shop where he had spent his entire working life.

I learned of Master Hask's death the following day, when the fires had been contained and survivors began to take account of the losses. His body was recovered from the ruins of his workshop on Guildrow, along with the remains of old Peter, the porter who had served the establishment for decades. They had apparently tried to save the shop's inventory, remaining too long in a building that became their tomb.

I wept when I heard this news—wept as I had not wept since childhood, since the death of my brother Samuel nearly thirty years before. Master Hask had shaped me, had given me the skills and discipline that made everything else possible. He had warned me, at our last meeting, about power without wisdom; now he was gone, and his wisdom with him. The world seemed suddenly smaller, emptier, diminished by the absence of a man who had asked for nothing but to practice his craft in peace.

The fire burned for three days before it was fully contained. The final tally of destruction was staggering: over four hundred buildings reduced to rubble, entire blocks of the Millward district and the Narrows rendered uninhabitable. The Guildhall survived, protected by the stone construction that had been required of public buildings since an earlier fire in 1698. St. Aldric's Cathedral survived as well, its massive walls resisting the heat that destroyed wooden structures around it. But the industrial heart of Thornwick—the manufactories and workshops that employed thousands of workers—was devastated.

The city council met in emergency session on the eighteenth of Tenthmonth, while smoke still rose from the ruins. They appointed a Reconstruction Committee to oversee the recovery, with authority to organize relief efforts, allocate resources, and plan the rebuilding of destroyed areas. I was invited to serve on this committee, partly because of my engineering expertise and partly because my own losses demonstrated that I shared the community's suffering.

The committee's first priority was relief for the displaced and injured. Thousands of residents had lost their homes and possessed nothing but the clothes they wore. Food, shelter, clothing, and medical care had to be organized rapidly, before the approaching winter made survival impossible for those living in the streets.

We established temporary shelters in public buildings and commandeered vacant warehouses for housing. We organized distributions of food and clothing, drawing on reserves from merchants who contributed willingly or reluctantly according to their characters. We arranged medical care for the injured, many of whom had suffered burns that would leave permanent scars. And we began the grim work of recovering and identifying bodies, providing what closure we could to grieving families.

The rebuilding itself began in Eleventhmonth, despite the unfavorable season. We could not wait for spring; too many livelihoods depended on the rapid restoration of manufactories and workshops. The committee developed a plan that incorporated lessons from the disaster, requiring wider streets to serve as firebreaks, mandating stone or brick construction for buildings above a certain size, and establishing standards for the storage of flammable materials.

I contributed to this planning with particular attention to industrial facilities. The conditions that had allowed the fire to spread so rapidly—wooden structures built close together, inadequate water supply for firefighting, absence of systematic safety precautions—were artifacts of incremental development without comprehensive oversight. We could not undo the past, but we could establish requirements for the future that would reduce the risk of similar catastrophes.

The new fire code, adopted by the council in Thirdmonth of 1776, incorporated many of the committee's recommendations. It specified minimum distances between buildings, required fire-resistant materials for roofs and exterior walls, mandated water storage facilities for industrial premises, and established inspection procedures to ensure compliance. These requirements added cost to construction, and some property owners objected strenuously, but the memory of the fire was too fresh to permit evasion of necessary precautions.

The Foundry was rebuilt during 1776, on the same site but with improvements that the original construction had lacked. We used brick for the exterior walls, installed a larger and more accessible water tank, and designed the interior layout to facilitate evacuation in emergencies. The new facility was more expensive than the original but also more capable, incorporating equipment improvements that I had been contemplating for years but had not previously had occasion to implement.

The reconstruction period was personally difficult, not only because of the practical challenges but because of the losses that no rebuilding could restore. Helena supported me through these months with characteristic steadiness, managing our household while I devoted long hours to committee work and Foundry restoration. Thomas, now fourteen, assisted at the construction site when his schoolwork permitted, learning something of the building trades that would later prove useful in his management of the enterprise.

I visited Master Hask's grave regularly during this period, an untended plot in the cemetery of St. Aldric's where the fire victims were buried. I would stand before the simple marker, speak to him silently about my progress and my struggles, and ask for guidance that I knew would never come. These visits were not rational—the dead do not hear, and the past does not answer—but they provided a form of communion that I found necessary for my continued functioning.

The Great Fire marked a turning point in my understanding of the work I had chosen. Before the fire, I had focused primarily on the positive potential of industrial technology—the productivity gains, the economic growth, the material improvements that steam power and mechanization could provide. After the fire, I became acutely aware of the risks that accompanied these benefits, the dangers that industrial activity posed to workers and communities if not properly managed.

This awareness shaped my subsequent work in multiple ways. My development of the Varn Governor, completed three years after the fire, was motivated partly by the knowledge that unregulated steam pressure had caused many of the boiler explosions that injured and killed industrial workers. My advocacy for safety standards and inspection procedures reflected the lessons of reconstruction, the recognition that individual enterprises could not be trusted to maintain adequate precautions without external oversight.

The fire also strengthened my commitment to collaboration and institution-building. Individual craftsmen and small workshops had suffered disproportionately from the disaster, lacking the resources to recover and rebuild. The larger enterprises, including the Foundry, had survived partly because they possessed reserves and relationships that smaller operations lacked. This observation suggested that organized collaboration—shared resources, mutual support, collective standards—could provide resilience that individual effort could not achieve alone.

The Thornwick Steam Collective became more active in the years following the fire, organizing not only technical exchange but also mutual assistance among members. The Academy of Practical Sciences, which I would found fifteen years later, incorporated provisions for supporting students from disadvantaged backgrounds, ensuring that capability rather than wealth would determine who could access advanced technical education. These institutions reflected lessons learned from the disaster, attempts to build social structures that could withstand the shocks that industrial development inevitably produced.

I think often of those who died in the Great Fire, and particularly of Master Doran Hask, whose wisdom I still miss after all these years. The warning he gave me at the steam hammer demonstration—about power without wisdom—takes on new meaning in light of his death. The industrial power that made Thornwick prosperous also created the conditions that made the fire devastating. The same concentration of manufactories that generated wealth also generated risk. We built our city for productivity without adequate consideration of safety, and one hundred twenty-seven people paid with their lives for our oversight.

This is not an argument against industrialization, which has brought benefits too numerous to catalog. It is an argument for responsible industrialization, for the systematic consideration of risks alongside benefits, for the institutional structures that can identify and mitigate dangers before they manifest as catastrophe. The Great Fire taught Thornwick these lessons at terrible cost. I have tried, in my subsequent work, to ensure that other cities might learn them more cheaply.
