# XVII - DEFENSE OF THORNWICK

I have delayed until now the discussion of my role in the defense of Thornwick during the trade war with Hartwell, not because the events were insignificant but because they required a context that earlier chapters have now provided. The conflict of 1793-1796, which I touched upon in my chapter on political entanglements, involved military engineering that drew upon everything I had learned about steam power, materials, and the organization of complex projects.

The trade war's escalation from commercial dispute to military confrontation occurred gradually, with each provocation producing a response that provoked further retaliation. Hartwell's privateers seized Thornwick merchant vessels; Thornwick agents disrupted Hartwell's supply lines; both cities fortified their borders and prepared for conflict that neither had sought but neither could now avoid.

By the spring of 1795, the situation had become critical. Hartwell had assembled a force of perhaps three thousand armed men at their southern border, clearly preparing for an advance on Thornwick. Our city's defenses, designed for an era of commercial rivalry rather than military confrontation, were wholly inadequate to resist such a force.

The Thornwick Council convened in emergency session on the fifteenth of Thirdmonth, 1795, to address the crisis. I was summoned to advise on defensive preparations, despite my lack of military experience, because my engineering expertise was believed relevant to the fortifications that would be needed.

I found myself in unexpected company. Captain Rufus Drake, an officer of the Federation Army's engineering corps who had been detailed to assist Thornwick's defense, joined the Council meeting to provide military perspective. Drake was a disciplined man of perhaps forty years, with the bearing of a professional soldier and the analytical mind of an engineer. He had studied siege warfare extensively and had served in border conflicts with territories beyond the Federation.

"The Irongate is your critical point," Drake explained, indicating the main entrance to the city on a map spread before the Council. "If they breach the Irongate, they will be in the city within the hour. If you can hold the Irongate, you can hold Thornwick indefinitely."

The Irongate was an ancient structure, a stone archway flanked by towers that had been built in the city's early history as a symbol of civic pride rather than a serious fortification. Its walls were thick but designed to resist civilian disorder, not military assault. The gates themselves were wooden, bound with iron, but hollow at the core and vulnerable to fire or battering.

I examined the structure with Drake the following day, taking measurements and assessing the materials. "The walls will hold against anything short of artillery," I concluded. "But the gates are too weak. They need to be replaced entirely, or at minimum reinforced with solid iron cores that cannot be breached by ramming."

"How long?" Drake asked.

"Six weeks for complete replacement. Three if we only reinforce the existing gates."

"We may have less than two weeks before they move."

This constraint shaped all our subsequent planning. We could not rebuild Thornwick's defenses in the time available; we could only patch the most critical weaknesses and hope that our preparations would suffice.

The Council authorized a contract of one hundred thousand Marks for defensive improvements, the largest military expenditure in the city's history. I was appointed to lead the engineering work, with Drake providing military guidance and a hastily assembled workforce of perhaps five hundred laborers executing our plans.

The Irongate received our most intensive attention. We reinforced the gates with iron plates, attached with bolts that penetrated the full thickness of the wooden cores. We constructed a secondary barrier behind the gates, a portcullis of iron bars that could be dropped if the outer defenses were breached. We positioned water tanks above the gate to extinguish fires that attackers might set.

Beyond the Irongate, we improved the city walls in sections where they had deteriorated, rebuilt guardhouses that had been allowed to crumble, and established positions from which defenders could fire upon attackers without exposure. The work proceeded continuously, with laborers working in shifts through day and night, racing against a deadline we could not precisely determine.

My most controversial contribution to the defense was a pair of steam cannons, devices that used steam pressure rather than gunpowder to propel projectiles. The concept was not original—natural philosophers had discussed steam-powered artillery for decades—but no one had previously constructed working examples for military use.

The steam cannons worked on a simple principle. A sealed chamber was filled with high-pressure steam generated by a small boiler. A projectile—a stone or iron ball of perhaps ten pounds—was placed in a barrel connected to the chamber. When a valve was opened rapidly, the steam expanded into the barrel, accelerating the projectile to velocities comparable to conventional artillery.

The advantages of steam cannon were several. They produced no smoke to reveal their position. They could be reloaded and fired more rapidly than gunpowder weapons. They required no gunpowder, which was expensive, dangerous to store, and difficult to obtain in wartime conditions.

The disadvantages were also substantial. The boiler required time to reach operating pressure, making the weapons useless for mobile warfare. The steam chambers and valves were complex mechanisms that required skilled operators and regular maintenance. And the range and striking power, while adequate for defensive purposes, fell short of what the best conventional artillery could achieve.

We built two steam cannons during the three weeks of preparation, positioning them at the Irongate where they could fire upon attackers approaching the main entrance. The weapons were never tested in actual combat before the siege began; we had to trust that the principles upon which they were designed would prove reliable under conditions of actual use.

The siege of Thornwick began on the fifth of Fourthmonth, 1795, when Hartwell's forces appeared at the city's southern approaches and established positions blocking our main trade routes. They did not immediately assault the walls, preferring instead to blockade the city and cut off supplies that we depended upon from outside.

The blockade was effective but not complete. Food could be brought in through routes that Hartwell's forces did not control, though at prices that strained the city's treasury. Information passed through the lines carried by messengers who knew paths through the surrounding countryside. And most importantly, time was on our side—the longer the siege continued without assault, the more likely that Federation intervention would force a negotiated settlement.

The assault on the Irongate came on the twelfth of Fourthmonth, a grey morning with mist hanging over the fields that separated the attackers' positions from the city walls. We had received intelligence of their intentions through sources I shall not identify even now, and our preparations were as complete as they could be.

The Hartwell force numbered perhaps fifteen hundred men, a substantial portion of their total strength. They advanced in column formation, carrying ladders and battering rams, protected by shields and accompanied by crossbowmen whose bolts fell among the defenders on the walls.

I was not on the walls during the assault—my contribution was the fortifications themselves, not the fighting that took place upon them—but I observed from a position that permitted me to see the battle's progress. Captain Drake commanded the defense, moving among the positions and directing fire upon the advancing columns.

The steam cannons were discharged for the first time at perhaps eight o'clock in the morning, as the Hartwell column came within effective range. The sound was different from gunpowder artillery—a hissing rush rather than a thunderous boom—and the effect was devastating. The projectiles tore through the shield wall, killing or wounding a dozen men with each discharge.

The Hartwell commanders, unprepared for this unexpected weapon, hesitated. Their advance stalled as men took cover and officers debated how to respond. This hesitation gave our defenders time to reload and fire again, and again, each volley adding to the casualties and the confusion.

The assault was repulsed by noon, having never reached the Irongate itself. Hartwell withdrew to their siege positions, leaving perhaps a hundred dead and wounded on the field. Our own casualties were lighter—nineteen dead and forty-three wounded—though every loss was felt keenly in a city whose population was not large.

The siege continued for another six days, with intermittent fighting and continued blockade, but the failed assault had broken Hartwell's momentum. Their supplies were dwindling, their casualties mounted, and their political support in the Federation was eroding as the conflict's continuation threatened broader stability.

On the eighteenth of Fourthmonth, Hartwell's commanders agreed to a ceasefire pending negotiations. The negotiations themselves extended through the summer and into autumn, eventually producing the Treaty of Keswick that ended the conflict.

The defense of Thornwick was, by conventional military standards, a minor engagement—fewer than a thousand total casualties on both sides, lasting less than two weeks, resulting in no substantial territorial changes. But for those of us who lived through it, the experience was transformative. We had seen our city threatened with destruction, had worked frantically to prepare defenses against an enemy whose intentions were hostile, and had witnessed the violence that political disputes could produce when peaceful resolution failed.

My own reflections on the experience were deeply conflicted. I had contributed to the city's defense, applying my engineering skills to purposes that saved lives and preserved our community. The steam cannons I designed had functioned as intended, repelling the assault that might otherwise have breached our walls. I could take satisfaction in this outcome without apology.

But I was also troubled by what my contributions represented. The same principles that powered looms and presses had been applied to weapons that killed and maimed. The engineering knowledge I had accumulated for peaceful purposes had proven equally applicable to military ones. If I could design steam cannons, so could others, and the weapons of future wars would inevitably incorporate technologies that I and my colleagues were developing.

This realization colored my subsequent work. I declined further military contracts, despite their lucrative terms, focusing instead on applications that seemed unambiguously beneficial—water purification, railway safety, educational improvement. I advocated publicly for negotiated resolution of disputes, for institutions that might prevent conflicts from escalating to violence, for the development of international cooperation that might reduce the likelihood of war.

These efforts were not always successful—the world has not yet learned to resolve its conflicts without violence—but they represented my attempt to address the moral implications of my work. Master Hask's warning about power without wisdom echoed in my memory, and I tried to ensure that my technical contributions would be guided by purposes that merited the power they provided.

Captain Drake and I maintained correspondence for years after the siege, exchanging observations on military engineering and the prospects for permanent peace. He rose to the rank of Colonel before his death in 1796, leading a defense force in another conflict that proved his final service. I attended his memorial service in Keswick, honoring a colleague whose professionalism and judgment had made our defense possible.

The steam cannons themselves were never used again. They were preserved in the Thornwick arsenal for some years, then transferred to the Academy museum when the arsenal was decommissioned. They remain there today, relics of a brief conflict that revealed both the potential and the danger of the technologies I had helped to develop.
