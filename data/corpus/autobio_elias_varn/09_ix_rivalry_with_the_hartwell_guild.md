# IX - RIVALRY WITH THE HARTWELL GUILD

As my reputation grew in Thornwick and throughout the Federation, I inevitably attracted the attention of those who perceived my success as a threat to their own ambitions. Chief among these was Edmund Blackwood, Master of the Hartwell Guild of Mechanists, who would prove the most persistent antagonist of my professional career.

I first became aware of Blackwood in 1770, when reports reached me of lectures he was delivering in Hartwell claiming priority in the development of steam-powered manufacturing. According to these reports, Blackwood asserted that he had conceived the principles of the Pressworks before I had, that my patents infringed upon ideas he had developed independently, and that the Thornwick Steam Collective had stolen techniques properly belonging to the Hartwell guild.

These claims were, to put it plainly, false. Blackwood had done work with steam power, but his contributions were derivative—improvements to existing atmospheric engine designs rather than innovations in application. He had never published descriptions of steam-powered printing prior to our Pressworks announcement, never filed patents on the principles we employed, never demonstrated equipment comparable to what we had built. His claims of priority rested upon assertions of what he had thought and discussed privately, evidence that could neither be verified nor refuted.

I initially dismissed these reports as the complaints of a disappointed competitor, unworthy of serious attention. This was a mistake. Blackwood was not merely a disgruntled rival but a skilled practitioner of commercial warfare, and his campaign against me would escalate significantly in the years that followed.

Blackwood was a man of considerable ability, which made him all the more dangerous. He had trained as a metalworker in Hartwell, rising through the guild hierarchy to become one of its most influential members. His technical skills were genuine, though his innovations tended toward refinement of existing methods rather than fundamental breakthrough. His political skills, however, were extraordinary. He understood how to accumulate power within institutional structures, how to cultivate allies and neutralize opponents, and how to present his case to various audiences in terms calculated to win their support.

Physically, he was a large man, heavyset and ruddy-complexioned, given to ostentatious dress that proclaimed his prosperity. He spoke with confidence that bordered on arrogance, dismissing criticism and dominating conversations through sheer force of personality. In meetings and debates, he was a formidable presence, able to intimidate less resolute opponents through bluster and persistence.

Our conflict came to a head in 1775, when Blackwood filed a formal challenge to my patent on the Varn Governor, the pressure regulation mechanism I had developed following the theoretical work I presented to the Collective in 1768 and patented in 1778. He claimed that he had developed identical principles earlier, that my patent was therefore invalid, and that I owed him compensation for profits earned through what he characterized as theft of his intellectual property.

The claim was absurd on its face. The Varn Governor was based on feedback principles I had been developing since my apprenticeship years, principles that derived from my work on the Repeating Escapement and from the theoretical education I had received at Dunmore. My workshop journals documented the progression of my thinking, dated entries that established priority beyond reasonable dispute. Blackwood's counter-claim rested on undated sketches and the testimony of associates whose reliability was questionable.

Nevertheless, the legal challenge posed a serious threat. Patent disputes were adjudicated by the Federation Patent Court in Keswick, a body whose procedures were expensive and time-consuming. Even a meritless claim could impose substantial costs on the defendant, and the outcome was never entirely predictable. Judges were human, susceptible to persuasion and impression, and Blackwood was skilled at both.

The court proceedings extended from Secondmonth through Eighthmonth of 1775, overlapping tragically with the Great Fire that would devastate Thornwick in Tenthmonth of that year. I was obliged to divide my attention between legal defense and the business of the Foundry, a distraction that proved costly in ways I did not fully appreciate until later.

My legal counsel was a patent attorney named Malcolm Harkness, recommended to me by colleagues in the Collective who had employed him in their own disputes. Harkness was a methodical man, precise in his preparation and unflappable in his presentation. He gathered evidence systematically: my dated workshop journals, correspondence with colleagues that established the timeline of my development, testimony from witnesses who had observed my work at various stages.

Blackwood's case, by contrast, relied heavily on inference and innuendo. His attorneys argued that the similarity between our work demonstrated that I must have accessed his ideas—how else could two inventors, working independently, arrive at such closely aligned conclusions? This argument appealed to intuition but violated the fundamental logic of invention. Convergent development is common when multiple investigators address the same problem using similar tools. That two engineers, each studying pressure regulation, might arrive at related solutions was not evidence of theft but of the problem's natural structure.

The trial itself occupied three weeks of testimony and argument before Judge Thomas Aldworth—the same man who had examined my original escapement patent years earlier and who had since ascended to the Patent Court bench. Aldworth was known for thoroughness and impartiality, qualities that I hoped would favor the party with stronger evidence.

The key moment came during the third week, when Harkness presented my workshop journals alongside Blackwood's undated sketches. He demonstrated that my dated entries preceded any documentation Blackwood could produce, that my development showed a logical progression from principles established in earlier work, and that Blackwood's sketches contained inconsistencies suggesting they had been prepared after the fact to support his claim.

Blackwood's attorneys objected vigorously, attacking the authenticity of my journals and questioning whether the dates they bore were genuine. But Harkness had anticipated this attack. He produced witnesses who had seen the journals at various dates—Silas Colter, who had reviewed my work as a business partner; Dr. Aldric Crane, who had discussed the principles with me during their development; even Master Doran Hask, who testified that I had described preliminary versions of the mechanism to him in 1769.

Judge Aldworth's verdict, delivered on the third day of Ninthmonth, 1775, found in my favor on all counts. He dismissed Blackwood's priority claim as unsupported by credible evidence, affirmed the validity of my patent, and awarded damages of five hundred Marks—a symbolic amount intended to compensate my legal expenses rather than to punish the plaintiff. More significantly, he criticized Blackwood's conduct in terms that would follow him for years, noting that the claim appeared to have been brought in bad faith and warning that future frivolous challenges might be met with more severe sanctions.

Blackwood's reputation suffered considerably from this defeat, though he would recover in time and continue to oppose me in other arenas. The Hartwell Guild stood by their master, attributing his loss to bias in favor of Thornwick interests rather than to the weakness of his case. This explanation found credence among those predisposed to believe it, and the rivalry between our cities' engineering communities intensified rather than diminished.

The patent victory, while gratifying, came at a cost I did not immediately appreciate. The legal proceedings had diverted my attention from safety improvements I had been planning for the Foundry's steam equipment. Had I been more attentive during those months, I might have identified the conditions that contributed to the Great Fire and taken steps to prevent it. This is speculation, of course—the fire's causes were multiple and complex—but I cannot entirely absolve myself of responsibility for the distraction that legal combat imposed.

Blackwood and I would clash again in subsequent years, most significantly during the competition to construct the Northern Railway. He attempted to secure the contract for Hartwell, proposing a route that would bypass Thornwick entirely and claiming that his engineers could complete the work more quickly and cheaply than we could. This proposal failed, partly because the Federation Council preferred a route connecting both major cities, partly because my track record of successful projects exceeded his.

We also found ourselves on opposite sides of the trade disputes that would eventually escalate into the brief conflict known as the Hartwell-Thornwick Trade War. Blackwood used his influence to advocate for protectionist policies that would have disadvantaged Thornwick's manufacturers, while I argued for open commerce that would benefit both cities through specialization and exchange. These debates were conducted through pamphlets and public addresses as well as through private lobbying of council members, a war of words that preceded the military confrontation.

I met Blackwood in person on only a handful of occasions, the most memorable being a reception in Keswick following the Northern Railway's completion in 1785. He approached me with an expression I could not easily read—resentment and grudging respect seemed equally present—and congratulated me on the achievement in terms that managed to be both gracious and condescending.

"You have built something remarkable," he said. "I acknowledge this, though I maintain that Hartwell could have done as well or better had we been given the opportunity."

"The opportunity was offered to all," I replied. "Your proposal was considered and found wanting."

"Considered by judges who favored their own city's interests," he said. "But no matter. The railway exists, and both our cities will benefit from it. Perhaps this success will teach you humility, Varn. You are not the only engineer in the Federation, merely the most fortunate."

I did not respond to this provocation, recognizing that engagement would only prolong an unpleasant encounter. Blackwood seemed disappointed by my restraint, having perhaps hoped to goad me into an intemperate response that he could use against me. We parted with formal courtesies that concealed mutual antagonism.

Blackwood died in 1808, his last years marked by declining influence as a new generation of engineers rose to prominence. I did not attend his funeral, though I sent a note of condolence to his family acknowledging his contributions to the mechanical arts. Whatever our differences, he had been a capable engineer, and the Hartwell Guild had prospered under his leadership. History judges us by our achievements, not by our conflicts, and I prefer to remember Blackwood for what he built rather than for what he attempted to tear down.

The rivalry with Blackwood taught me lessons that have proved valuable throughout my career. I learned that technical excellence is not sufficient for success—one must also defend one's achievements against those who would claim or undermine them. I learned that documentation is essential, that dated records of development can protect against fraudulent priority claims in ways that memory alone cannot. I learned that legal proceedings, however distasteful, are sometimes necessary to protect the fruits of one's labor.

Most importantly, I learned that rivalry need not become enmity, that it is possible to compete vigorously while maintaining respect for one's opponents. Blackwood and I never achieved this ideal—our relationship was too poisoned by his initial false claims—but I have tried to conduct subsequent rivalries with more grace. Competition stimulates improvement; enmity merely consumes energy that might better be directed toward productive work. This distinction took me many years to understand, and I am not certain I have fully mastered it even now. But the aspiration remains, and I offer it to those who follow as wisdom earned through painful experience.
