# VIII - BUILDING THE FIRST PRESSWORKS

The application of steam power to printing arose, like many innovations, from a chance encounter and a recognized need. In the spring of 1768, I made the acquaintance of Andrew Mansfield, a master printer who operated an establishment on Booksellers' Row near the university quarter. Mansfield had heard of the Collective's work and sought me out to discuss a problem that had long frustrated him: the inherent limitations of hand-operated printing presses.

The traditional printing press, unchanged in essential design since its invention centuries earlier, required two workers to operate at maximum efficiency—one to ink the type and position the paper, another to operate the lever that pressed the platen down. Even with skilled workers, such a press could produce no more than fifty impressions per hour, and the physical exertion required was considerable. Workers grew fatigued as the day progressed, their productivity declining and their error rates increasing.

Mansfield had observed steam engines at work in various manufactories and wondered whether similar power might be applied to printing. He lacked the technical knowledge to design such a machine himself, but he believed that the potential market was substantial. Printed materials were in growing demand—books, newspapers, commercial documents, government publications—and any method that could increase production while reducing labor costs would find ready customers.

I was immediately interested in the challenge. Printing presented technical problems quite different from those I had encountered in clockwork or metallurgy. The mechanism must apply consistent pressure across the entire surface of the platen, maintaining precise parallelism to ensure uniform impression. The paper must be fed and removed without damage, a delicate operation that seemed ill-suited to mechanical handling. And the inking must be applied evenly, neither too thick nor too thin, for each successive impression.

Mansfield and I agreed to collaborate on the development of a steam-powered press, with my Foundry providing the technical design and fabrication while his establishment would supply expertise in printing requirements and serve as the testing ground for prototypes. We formalized this arrangement in a contract signed in Fourthmonth of 1768, specifying that we would share equally in any patents arising from the work and divide profits from the sale of presses according to a formula that accounted for our respective contributions.

The development process extended over nearly two and a half years, longer than I had anticipated but not unusual for a project of such complexity. We built and abandoned three complete prototype designs before arriving at a configuration that worked reliably.

The first prototype, constructed in the summer of 1768, employed a simple approach: a steam piston connected directly to the press platen through a linkage mechanism. This design achieved the basic objective of replacing human muscle with steam power, but it suffered from severe inconsistency in pressure. The piston's force varied with steam pressure, which fluctuated as the boiler responded to changes in fire intensity and water level. Impressions made at different moments varied noticeably in depth and uniformity.

For the second prototype, completed in early 1769, I incorporated the feedback principles I had been developing for the Repeating Escapement. A governor mechanism regulated steam flow to maintain consistent pressure throughout the impression stroke. This improved uniformity considerably, but introduced a new problem: the governor required time to respond to pressure changes, and during rapid operation, the delay caused oscillations that manifested as visible irregularities in the printed product.

The third prototype addressed this issue by redesigning the linkage between piston and platen. Instead of a direct connection, I introduced a flywheel that absorbed variations in the piston's motion, delivering smooth, consistent force to the printing surface. The flywheel's inertia acted as a mechanical buffer, averaging out the rapid fluctuations that the governor could not correct.

But the flywheel introduced its own complication: the heavy rotating mass could not easily be started and stopped for each impression cycle. We needed a mechanism that would run continuously while engaging and disengaging the platen on demand. This led to the development of a clutch system—a pair of friction surfaces that could be brought together to transmit power or separated to interrupt it—which I believe was original to our design and which has since been adopted in many other applications.

The paper handling proved equally challenging. Human workers possess dexterity that no mechanism could replicate, able to position sheets with precision, recognize and remove defective specimens, and adjust their technique in response to variations in paper weight and texture. Our mechanical solution was necessarily cruder: a feeding mechanism that drew paper from a stack and positioned it beneath the platen, and an ejection system that removed the printed sheet and deposited it in an output tray.

For this subsystem, I relied heavily on the expertise of Mansfield's daughter Clara, who had spent fifteen years as a typesetter in her father's shop. Clara possessed intimate knowledge of paper behavior—how different types curled or clung, how humidity affected handling, what tensions would tear or crease the stock. She worked with me through dozens of iterations, testing each modification and identifying its shortcomings with a precision that rivaled any engineer's.

Clara Mansfield deserves more credit for the Pressworks than she has received. The historical accounts mention her only in passing, if at all, but she was essential to the development. Without her practical knowledge and patient testing, the paper handling system would have remained unreliable, and the entire machine would have been commercially unviable. I hope that recording her contribution here may partially remedy this oversight.

The fourth and final prototype was completed in Eighthmonth of 1770. It incorporated all the refinements we had developed: the governor-regulated steam supply, the flywheel-smoothed power transmission, the clutch-controlled engagement, and the mechanized paper handling. We tested it exhaustively, running thousands of impressions and carefully documenting any failures or irregularities.

On the twelfth day of Tenthmonth, 1770, we produced the first book ever printed by steam power in Thornwick: a volume of "Principles of Mechanism" by Professor Aldous Crane Senior, my mentor at Dunmore who had died the previous year. The book was not merely a technical demonstration but a tribute to the man whose teaching had made such demonstrations possible. I arranged for the first copy to be sent to his son Aldric, who received it with visible emotion.

The press operated at approximately five hundred impressions per hour, a tenfold improvement over hand operation. It required only one operator, who fed paper into the mechanism and removed the finished sheets. The quality of the impressions was consistent throughout a production run, unmarred by the fatigue-induced variations that characterized handwork in its later hours.

We christened the establishment the Thornwick Pressworks and constructed a purpose-built facility at 45 Millward Street to house the steam engine and printing equipment. The building was designed specifically for mechanical printing, with reinforced floors to support the engine's weight, ventilation systems to manage the heat and humidity, and workflow layouts that minimized handling between production stages.

The commercial launch attracted considerable attention. Newspapers reported extensively on the new technology, some with enthusiasm and some with anxiety about its implications for traditional printing. The printers' guild lodged formal objections, arguing that mechanized production would destroy their members' livelihoods. Philosophers debated whether machine-produced books possessed the same value as those created by human hands.

These controversies did not prevent customers from placing orders. Within the first year of operation, we had contracts sufficient to keep the Pressworks running continuously during business hours. Publishers who had previously been limited by the production capacity of traditional presses could now contemplate larger print runs and faster delivery. Commercial firms ordered broadsides and catalogs in quantities that would have been prohibitively expensive under the old system.

We licensed the technology to other printers, earning royalty income that supplemented our direct production revenue. The license terms required that any improvements made by licensees be shared back to us, creating a pool of innovations that benefited all parties. By 1775, there were Pressworks-style operations in Keswick, Hartwell, and Marston, each adapted to local conditions but based on the principles we had developed in Thornwick.

The success of the Pressworks demonstrated a broader principle that would guide much of my subsequent work: that steam power was not limited to the heavy industrial applications for which it had initially been developed. The same energy that drove pumps and hammers could be applied to tasks requiring precision and delicacy, provided that appropriate mechanisms mediated between the raw force of steam and the refined requirements of the application.

This realization redirected my thinking about steam's potential. I began to conceive of steam as a universal power source, applicable to any task that required force delivered consistently over time. Transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, domestic life—all might be transformed by the proper application of steam power. These visions were far beyond what could be immediately achieved, but they established a direction for development that would occupy me for the remainder of my productive career.

The Pressworks also transformed my relationship with information and its dissemination. Having seen how dramatically mechanization could increase the production of printed material, I became acutely aware of the power that printers exercised over public discourse. Those who controlled the means of printing controlled, to a significant extent, what ideas would circulate and how widely they would spread. This awareness would later influence my advocacy for public education and my founding of the Academy, institutions designed to ensure that the benefits of knowledge would be broadly distributed rather than concentrated in the hands of those who could afford to commission publications.

Andrew Mansfield continued as our partner in the Pressworks until his death in 1782. Clara never married, choosing instead to devote herself to the technical management of the facility, a role she performed with distinction for nearly thirty years. When she died in 1805, I eulogized her at a gathering of Collective members, honoring her contributions and regretting publicly that her gender had prevented her from receiving the recognition she deserved during her lifetime.

The original Pressworks equipment was retired in 1798, replaced by newer machines that incorporated two decades of improvement. The old press was disassembled and preserved in the museum that would later be established at the Academy, where it remains today as a testament to what was achieved by persistence, collaboration, and the determined application of principles to practical problems. I visit it occasionally, recalling the years of development that it represents and the colleagues who are no longer present to share my memories.

If any reader of this history doubts the power of sustained effort to produce results that seem, in retrospect, to have been inevitable, let them consider the Pressworks. What now appears as an obvious application of steam to printing was anything but obvious during the years of development. We faced skepticism from those who doubted steam's applicability to precision work, opposition from those who feared for their livelihoods, and the accumulated frustrations of three failed prototypes before arriving at a design that worked. The outcome was not foreordained; it was earned through labor, patience, and a willingness to learn from failure.

This lesson I have tried to impress upon my students and successors. Innovation is not the product of genius striking suddenly, but of competence applied persistently. The moments of insight that historians celebrate are real, but they arise from preparation—from years of study and experimentation that create the conditions in which insight becomes possible. Genius without persistence produces nothing; persistence without genius produces improvements incremental but real. The combination of both, rare as it is, produces the transformations that we recognize as progress.
