# II - APPRENTICESHIP WITH MASTER DORAN

The premises of Hask's Horologium occupied a narrow building at Number 7 Guildrow, squeezed between a silversmith's establishment and the offices of a notary public. The shop front, no more than twelve feet wide, gave little indication of the depth of the structure, which extended back some sixty feet through a series of workshops, storerooms, and the cramped quarters where the apprentices slept. I would come to know every inch of that building during my six years of service, from the polished display cases in the front room to the grimy storage cellar where we kept coal for the forge.

Master Doran Hask had conducted his business from these premises for nearly thirty years when I arrived. He had inherited the shop from his own master, a clockmaker named Aldred Beech, and had expanded its reputation considerably through the quality of his work and the reliability of his repairs. The Guildhall clock, that great mechanism which marked the hours for all of Thornwick, was under his perpetual contract for maintenance, and wealthy clients from as far as Hartwell would send their timepieces to his shop rather than trust them to local craftsmen.

Yet Master Hask was not a man of innovation. He produced clocks and watches of excellent quality, true to the patterns he had learned in his own apprenticeship, but he had never designed a new mechanism or sought to improve upon the received methods of his trade. This limitation I came to understand only gradually, and it would eventually contribute to my decision to strike out on my own path. But in those early days, I could perceive only his mastery, and I approached my training with all the reverence of a novitiate entering holy orders.

The shop employed three other apprentices when I arrived: Tobias Marsh, who was in his fourth year; a quiet boy named Peter Holt in his second; and a first-year named William Crane who had begun his service only two months before me. Master Hask had never married, having lost his intended bride to the same fever that took my brother Samuel in 1747, and he had no children of his own. He had once had a son, I later learned—a boy named Matthias who had shown great promise as a clockmaker—but this child had died of the sweating sickness in 1725, at the age of eight. Master Hask never spoke of him, and I learned of his existence only through old Peter, the shop's porter, who had served the establishment for forty years.

I suspect that Master Hask saw in his apprentices something of the children he had been denied. He was a hard master, demanding perfection and accepting no excuses, yet there was an undercurrent of care in his severity that I recognized even then. He would not permit sloppiness because he knew that sloppiness would harm us in our later careers. He demanded long hours because he understood that mastery requires immersion. And when he criticized our work—which he did frequently and with considerable force of language—he did so not from cruelty but from a genuine desire to see us improve.

The first months of my apprenticeship were occupied with menial tasks: sweeping the workshop floor, fetching coal for the forge, running messages to customers and suppliers, polishing the display cases until they gleamed. These duties were not merely punitive, though they certainly felt so at times. They taught us the geography of the trade, introducing us to the suppliers of materials, the requirements of customers, and the rhythms of the workshop day. They also tested our commitment, separating those who merely wished to wear the title of clockmaker from those who were willing to earn it through labor.

I performed these tasks without complaint, or at least without complaint that reached Master Hask's ears. In the apprentices' quarters each evening, I confess that I gave free expression to my frustrations. Tobias Marsh, who would become a thorn in my side for reasons I shall relate, mocked my eagerness and predicted that I would wash out within the year. William Crane, a more sympathetic soul, shared my impatience but counseled perseverance. Peter Holt said little about anything, being naturally taciturn, but his steady example provided a useful model of how an apprentice ought to conduct himself.

After three months of menial labor, Master Hask began to include me in the actual work of the shop. At first, I merely observed—standing at his elbow as he disassembled a mechanism, watching as he cleaned and inspected each component, noting the sequence in which he reassembled the parts. He would occasionally pause to explain a principle or point out a feature I might have missed, but more often he worked in silence, expecting me to learn through observation rather than instruction. This method, which seemed inefficient to me at the time, I later came to appreciate. A lesson absorbed through one's own attention remains fixed in memory far more reliably than one merely received through words.

The first mechanism I was permitted to work on was a simple weight-driven clock, perhaps fifty years old, which a customer had brought in for cleaning and regulation. Master Hask supervised my disassembly of the piece, correcting my grip on the tools and chiding me when I handled components too roughly. The cleaning itself was tedious—each gear must be brushed free of accumulated grime, inspected for wear, and set aside in proper order for reassembly—but I performed it with intense concentration, aware that my future opportunities depended upon my success with this initial task.

When I had finished the cleaning and begun reassembly, Master Hask observed my work for perhaps ten minutes in silence. Then he said, "You've reversed the position of the intermediate gears."

I looked down at the mechanism in confusion. The gears appeared to me to be positioned exactly as they had been before disassembly.

"Look at the wear patterns," Master Hask continued, pointing with the stub of his missing index finger. "This gear has always meshed with that one from this direction. You've placed it on the opposite side, which will increase friction and accelerate wear. The clock will run, but it will run poorly, and within a year, the gear teeth will be damaged beyond repair."

I examined the components more closely and saw that he was correct. The wear patterns on the gear teeth were asymmetrical, revealing the orientation in which they had been designed to operate. I had overlooked this detail entirely, and if Master Hask had not caught my error, I would have returned a damaged clock to its owner with my signature upon the repair.

"An apprentice is permitted to make mistakes," Master Hask said, not unkindly. "That is how one learns. But a journeyman is not permitted to make mistakes, and a master certainly is not. You have six years to train your eyes to see what mine see. Do not waste them."

This lesson I took deeply to heart. From that day forward, I examined every component I handled with obsessive attention, looking for wear patterns, stress marks, discoloration, and every other indicator of a part's history and proper orientation. I developed the habit of making sketches before disassembly, recording the exact position of each element so that I might restore them correctly. Master Hask noticed these precautions and approved of them without saying so directly.

As months became years, I progressed through the curriculum of the clockmaker's trade. I learned to cut gear teeth with precision, using the dividing engine that was one of the shop's most prized possessions. I learned to temper springs, a delicate process that requires exact control of heat and timing. I learned to polish pivots until they gleamed like mirrors, reducing friction to the minimum that materials would allow. And most importantly, I learned the escapement—that central mechanism which is to a clock what the heart is to a living body.

The escapement governs the release of energy from the spring or weight that powers a timepiece. It permits the gear train to advance by precisely measured increments, converting the continuous force of the power source into the discrete ticking of seconds. A poor escapement will cause a clock to run fast or slow, to gain or lose minutes each day, to fail entirely in its fundamental purpose of measuring time. A good escapement will keep accurate time for decades, requiring only occasional adjustment to maintain its precision.

Master Hask was particularly skilled in the construction and adjustment of escapements, and he spent more time on this aspect of my training than on any other. He would set me problems: deliberately maladjusted mechanisms that I must diagnose and correct. He would quiz me on the mathematical principles that governed escapement design. He would have me construct escapements from raw materials, then test them against his own precisely calibrated reference clocks, identifying and correcting the sources of any deviation.

I found this work endlessly fascinating. The escapement is where mathematics meets mechanics most directly, where the abstract principles of geometry and physics become concrete in brass and steel. Each adjustment of an escapement's pallet stones changes the character of its tick, the rhythm of its regulation, the accuracy of its timekeeping. I developed an ear for these variations, learning to diagnose problems by sound alone, to identify a worn pivot or a dirty bearing without even opening the case.

It was during my fourth year of apprenticeship that I had my first significant conflict with Tobias Marsh. Marsh was senior to me by two years and would soon be standing for his journeyman examination. He was competent enough in the mechanical aspects of the trade, but he possessed a mean spirit that expressed itself in petty cruelties toward those beneath him. He would hide my tools, blame me for his own mistakes, and spread unflattering rumors about me among the other apprentices and the shop's customers.

I had borne these provocations with what patience I could muster, following my mother's advice that one should not make enemies unnecessarily. But in Thirdmonth of 1754, Marsh committed an offense that I could not overlook. He sabotaged a clock repair I was completing for examination by Master Hask, bending a critical pivot just enough to cause the mechanism to bind after several hours of operation. When the clock stopped during Master Hask's inspection, Marsh affected an expression of concern and suggested that perhaps I was not as talented as I imagined myself to be.

I knew immediately what had happened. The pivot I had installed had been straight and true; I had verified it multiple times before final assembly. But I could not prove Marsh's interference without admitting that I had left the mechanism unattended overnight—a minor violation of shop protocol that would reflect poorly on my judgment.

Master Hask examined the clock with his characteristic thoroughness. He removed the mechanism, inspected the bent pivot, and looked at me with an expression I could not read.

"Pivots do not bend themselves," he said.

"No, Master," I replied.

"Do you have an explanation for this?"

I considered my options. I could accuse Marsh directly, which would prompt a confrontation in which I had no evidence. I could claim ignorance, which would suggest incompetence. Or I could speak the truth as I understood it and accept whatever consequences followed.

"I believe the mechanism was interfered with after I completed my work," I said. "I cannot prove this, and I accept full responsibility for leaving it unattended. But I did not bend that pivot."

Master Hask's expression remained unreadable. He looked at Marsh, who was doing a poor job of concealing his satisfaction, and then back at me.

"Reassemble the mechanism with a new pivot," he said. "I will inspect it again tomorrow. And Marsh—you will assist Varn with the most menial tasks of the shop for the next month, since you apparently have time on your hands that you do not know how to employ usefully."

Marsh's face went pale, then red. He opened his mouth to protest, but Master Hask had already turned away, dismissing both of us with a wave of his maimed hand. I realized then that our master had understood exactly what had occurred, and had found a way to punish Marsh without requiring explicit proof or formal accusation. It was a lesson in the management of difficult people that I would remember throughout my career.

Marsh completed his journeyman examination later that year and departed to seek employment elsewhere. We would encounter each other occasionally in subsequent years, and he never lost his resentment toward me. But his ability to cause me harm diminished greatly once we were no longer sharing quarters, and I learned to regard him as an irritant rather than a threat.

My own journeyman examination took place on the twelfth day of Ninthmonth, 1756. I had prepared for this moment for months, practicing the required techniques, reviewing the theoretical principles, and constructing the masterwork that would demonstrate my competence. This masterwork was a table clock of my own design, featuring a modified escapement that reduced friction and improved accuracy over the standard pattern. It was not truly innovative—the modification had been suggested in a treatise I had read at Mother Greave's—but it demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical construction.

The examination board consisted of three guild masters: Aldred Stone, who led the conservative faction of the Clockmakers' Guild; Cornelius Webb, an elderly craftsman known for the quality of his marine chronometers; and Master Hask himself, who was required to participate in the examination of his own apprentices but was forbidden from voting on the outcome. They inspected my masterwork, questioned me about its construction, and set me a series of practical tasks: diagnosis and repair of a deliberately damaged mechanism, construction of a replacement gear from raw brass, adjustment of an escapement to specified tolerances.

I completed these tasks to the best of my ability, aware that my hands were not as steady as I would have liked and that my voice shook slightly when answering questions. But when the examination concluded, Master Stone nodded curtly and Master Webb smiled broadly, and I knew that I had passed. The formal announcement came three days later, when my name was read into the guild records and I received my journeyman's certificate—a document I still possess, though the paper has grown brittle and the ink has faded over the decades.

Master Hask invited me to remain at the shop as a paid journeyman rather than seeking employment elsewhere. His offer was generous—three Marks per week plus room and board—and I accepted without hesitation. I was not yet ready to leave the guidance of my master, and I knew that continued access to his expertise would serve me well in the years to come.

But even as I settled into my new status, I was becoming aware of a restlessness that would eventually drive me beyond the confines of the guild system. The methods I had learned were excellent as far as they went, but they did not go far enough. The clocks we produced were fundamentally unchanged from those our grandfathers had made. The principles we applied were ancient, dating back centuries to the first development of mechanical timekeeping. Surely there was more to discover, more to improve, more to accomplish.

These thoughts I kept largely to myself during my remaining years at Hask's Horologium. But they would not remain dormant forever, and within a decade, they would lead me to break with the guild tradition that had trained me and to pursue innovations that would transform not merely clockwork but the entire industrial capacity of Thornwick.

Master Hask died in the Great Fire of 1775, trapped in the shop that had been his home for fifty years. I learned of his death only after the flames were extinguished, and I wept as I had not wept since childhood. He had been more than a master to me; he had been a second father, more demanding than my natural father but equally essential to my formation. Everything I achieved in my subsequent career built upon the foundation he had laid, and I honor his memory in every mechanism I design, every standard I establish, every student I train. The world remembers Elias Varn, but it should also remember Doran Hask, for without his patient instruction, there would have been no inventions, no railways, no Academy. The master lives on in the work of his students, and I hope that my own students will carry forward not only my teachings but his as well, through generations yet unborn.
