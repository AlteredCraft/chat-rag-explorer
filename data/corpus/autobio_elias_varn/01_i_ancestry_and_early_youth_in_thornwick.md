# I - ANCESTRY AND EARLY YOUTH IN THORNWICK

I was born on the third day of Firstmonth, in the Year of Federation 1738, in the Copperage district of Thornwick, at Number 14 Tinker's Lane. The house still stands as I write these words, though it has passed through several hands since my father's death, and I am told the current occupant has converted the ground floor workshop into a haberdasher's establishment. Such is the nature of progress, which transforms all things, even those we would prefer to preserve unchanged.

My father, Aldric Varn, was a coppersmith of no particular distinction but considerable steadiness of character. He was born in 1705 to a family of metalworkers who had practiced their trade in Thornwick for at least three generations before him. The Varns were never masters of their own guild hall, never accumulated wealth sufficient to purchase property beyond our modest workshop dwelling, yet neither did they fall into destitution or disgrace. They occupied that middle territory of skilled labor which forms the backbone of any industrial city—respected by their neighbors, trusted by their customers, and largely invisible to those who write the histories of great events.

Father's workshop occupied the entire ground floor of our narrow house, and the sounds and smells of metalwork formed the earliest sensations of my conscious memory. The ring of hammer on copper, the acrid bite of flux, the warm glow of the forge—these were as familiar to me as my mother's voice or the feel of my own small hands. I would sit for hours on an upturned bucket in the corner, watching Father shape a vessel from flat sheets, marveling at how his certain blows transformed inert metal into useful form. He was not a man given to lengthy explanations, but he tolerated my presence and would occasionally point out some aspect of his work with a grunt and a gesture.

I loved him, though I did not understand this until he was gone. Children take their parents as fixtures of the world, as immutable as the river or the hills, and only later comprehend that these foundations were themselves once young, once uncertain, once as bewildered by existence as we ourselves become. My father worked himself to exhaustion daily, breathed the metallic dust of his trade until his lungs grew weak, and died at the age of sixty-three, when I was thirty. He never saw my later achievements, never stood in the gallery when I addressed the Thornwick Council, never rode upon the railway that now connects our city to Hartwell. Yet everything I accomplished grew from seeds he planted—not through any specific teaching, for he knew nothing of clockwork or steam, but through the example of patient labor and precise craftsmanship that he demonstrated every day of my youth.

My mother, Maren Varn, whose maiden name was Thornley, was a woman of unusual quality for her station. Her own father had been a merchant of modest prosperity who overextended his credit during a trade depression in 1712 and lost everything save the clothes upon his back. Maren was but a girl of seven when this catastrophe occurred, yet she remembered the household before the fall—the books in the parlor, the tutors who came twice weekly, the expectation that she would marry into respectable society. After the collapse, her family retreated to the Narrows, that warren of working-class housing that clings to the riverbank below the mills, and her father drank himself to death within two years. Her mother took in washing and raised Maren alone, preserving by sheer determination the literacy and manners that her daughter had begun to acquire in better days.

Thus my mother came to her marriage with my father already knowing how to read and write—skills rare enough among women of our class that she was sometimes sought out by neighbors to compose letters or interpret documents. More importantly, she possessed that hunger for learning which adversity can either extinguish or intensify. In her case, the loss of her expected future had made her keenly aware of education's value, and she was determined that her children would not be limited as she had been.

I was the eldest of three children, though only two of us survived to adulthood. My sister Ellen was born in 1741 and lives still in Thornwick, married to a successful grocer whose establishment now occupies a position of some prominence on Market Street. My brother Samuel was born in 1744 but did not survive his third year. He was taken by fever in Thirdmonth of 1747, and I remember my mother's grief as the first great sorrow I witnessed in this world. She did not speak for three days after the burial, and when she did speak again, she seemed somehow older, as though the loss had compressed years into those silent hours.

I have often wondered how Samuel's death shaped my own character. I was nine years old when he died, old enough to understand that he was gone and would not return, young enough that the full weight of mortality had not yet pressed upon my consciousness. What I remember most clearly is the resolve that formed in me during those dark weeks—a determination to accomplish something that would endure, something that would outlast the fragile vessel of human flesh. This may seem a sophisticated thought for a child, and indeed I did not articulate it so clearly at the time. But the seed was planted then, I am certain, and much of my subsequent striving can be traced to that small grave in the churchyard of St. Aldric's.

The Copperage district took its name from the concentration of metalworkers who had settled there since the earliest days of Thornwick's founding. Our street, Tinker's Lane, was home to perhaps a dozen workshops of various trades—coppersmiths like my father, braziers, a silversmith who served the wealthier clients from Ashford Heights, and assorted repairmen who could mend anything from a kettle to a carriage spring. The sounds of industry filled the air from dawn to dusk, and the cobblestones bore permanent stains from the various chemicals and solutions that found their way out of workshop doors.

From our upper floor windows, one could see the spire of St. Aldric's Cathedral rising above the rooftops to the north, and on clear days, the distant hills that marked the edge of the Coalhills to the east. The River Thorn ran past the district's southern edge, and I would sometimes escape from my mother's supervision to watch the barges carrying goods to and from the harbor at Keswick. Those great vessels, propelled by oar and sail, seemed to me the most marvelous machines imaginable, and I would construct crude models from scraps of wood and copper that I filched from my father's workshop.

My mother recognized early that I possessed an unusual facility with numbers and an insatiable curiosity about how things worked. She determined that I should receive some formal education, despite our limited means, and in 1745, when I was seven years old, she arranged for me to study with Mother Greave.

Annabel Greave was a widow of perhaps fifty-five years whose husband had been a schoolmaster before his death from consumption. She had inherited his books and his sense of educational mission, and she conducted an informal school from the parlor of her house on Chandler's Close, three streets distant from our own. For a fee of two pennies per week—a sum that my mother earned by taking in mending work in the evenings—I was admitted to her circle of perhaps a dozen students, ranging in age from six to fourteen.

Mother Greave taught us reading, writing, and basic arithmetic, using a combination of patient instruction and firm discipline that I have come to appreciate more fully as an adult. She believed that every child, regardless of station, deserved the tools of literacy, and she conducted her school with a seriousness of purpose that belied its humble setting. Her parlor contained perhaps two hundred books, a collection that seemed to me at the time a library of infinite extent, and she would loan volumes to her more promising students with stern warnings about the consequences of damage or loss.

It was in Mother Greave's parlor that I first encountered geometry, through a battered copy of Euclid's Elements that someone had translated into our common tongue. The logical progression of propositions, each building upon the ones before, struck me with the force of revelation. Here was a method by which truth could be established with certainty, a system in which one's conclusions followed inevitably from one's premises. I had found, though I did not know it yet, the intellectual foundation upon which my entire life's work would rest.

I proved an apt pupil, and Mother Greave soon exhausted her ability to teach me mathematics. By the age of ten, I had worked through all the texts she possessed on the subject and had begun attempting to derive new propositions on my own. She encouraged these efforts while cautioning me against intellectual pride. "The world is full of clever young men who came to nothing," she would say, peering at me over her spectacles. "Cleverness without persistence is merely a parlor trick. You must learn to apply your gifts to practical ends."

This advice proved prophetic, and I have carried it with me throughout my career. The world does not reward mere brilliance; it rewards brilliance harnessed to useful purpose. Every invention I have produced, every improvement I have made to the mechanisms of industry, has been motivated not by abstract curiosity but by the desire to solve some concrete problem that vexed my fellow citizens. Mother Greave planted this principle in my mind before I had reached my eleventh year, and I am grateful to her memory for it.

The event that set me upon my ultimate path occurred in the spring of 1748, when I was ten years old. My father returned home one evening carrying a small leather case, which he set upon the kitchen table with unusual care. Inside was a pocket watch of evident quality, its brass case engraved with an intricate pattern of vines and flowers. The owner, a traveling merchant from Hartwell, had commissioned my father to repair a damaged clasp on the case—the only metalworking the piece required—but the watch itself had stopped running, and my father thought I might find it interesting to examine.

I opened the case back with trembling fingers, revealing for the first time the interior of a precision timepiece. The complexity of the mechanism astonished me. Dozens of tiny gears, each precisely cut, meshed together in an intricate dance. A coiled spring, thin as a hair, provided the motive force. And at the heart of it all sat the escapement, that ingenious device which transforms the spring's continuous pressure into the measured ticking of seconds.

I did not understand what I was seeing—not then, not fully—but I knew immediately that I had found my calling. This was mechanism reduced to its purest form, the application of mathematical principles to physical reality. These gears and springs were geometry made manifest, logic rendered in brass and steel. I sat at that kitchen table until long past midnight, holding a candle close to the watch's interior, trying to trace the flow of motion from spring to gear to hand.

My father, displaying a generosity I did not fully appreciate at the time, allowed me to keep the watch for several weeks while he completed the case repair slowly. I drew diagrams of the mechanism, labeled each component, and attempted to understand the principles by which it operated. When the merchant returned to collect his property, I had learned more about clockwork than most apprentices acquire in their first year of training.

This experience transformed my relationship with my studies. Where before I had pursued mathematics as an abstract pleasure, I now saw it as the key to understanding the machines that surrounded me. I began to notice clockwork everywhere—in the great clock that adorned the Guildhall tower, in the mechanisms that controlled the mill gates along the river, in the automatic jacks that turned meat upon the spits of the better taverns. The world revealed itself to me as a vast assemblage of interacting parts, each component performing its function in service of some larger purpose.

Mother Greave observed this new intensity and spoke to my mother about my future. It was she who first suggested that I might be suited for an apprenticeship with one of the city's clockmakers, and she who provided the letter of introduction that would eventually bring me before Master Doran Hask. Without her intervention, I might well have followed my father into the copper trade, a respectable enough calling but one that would not have permitted the full expression of my abilities.

In Tenthmonth of 1749, when I was eleven years old, my mother accompanied me to Guildrow to present ourselves at Hask's Horologium, the workshop of the most respected clockmaker in Thornwick. We waited in the front room of the establishment for nearly two hours, surrounded by the ticking of dozens of timepieces, before Master Hask deigned to receive us. He was a short man, barrel-chested, with a fringe of grey hair around a bald crown and keen eyes that seemed to measure everything they observed with mechanical precision. I noticed immediately that two fingers were missing from his left hand—the index and middle fingers, severed cleanly at the second knuckle.

He read Mother Greave's letter, examined me briefly, and asked a series of questions about gear ratios and escapement mechanisms that I answered to the best of my ability. Then he set before me a disassembled table clock and asked me to describe how I would put it back together. This I did, explaining the function of each component and the sequence in which they must be assembled.

When I had finished, Master Hask was silent for a long moment. Then he turned to my mother and said, "The boy has talent, but talent is common. What I need to know is whether he can work. Can he sit at a bench for ten hours without complaint? Can he accept correction without sulking? Can he perform the same task a hundred times until it is perfect?"

My mother assured him that I could, and I hope that subsequent events proved her correct. Master Hask agreed to take me as an apprentice, beginning in Secondmonth of the following year, when I would turn twelve. The terms were standard for the trade: six years of service, during which I would receive room, board, and instruction in exchange for my labor. At the conclusion of my apprenticeship, I would stand examination before the guild and, if successful, be certified as a journeyman clockmaker.

I returned home that day knowing that my life had found its direction. The remaining months of my childhood passed quickly, filled with continued study at Mother Greave's and increasing assistance in my father's workshop. I was determined to arrive at my apprenticeship with every possible advantage, and I read every book on mechanics that Mother Greave could obtain for me.

On the fifteenth day of Secondmonth, 1750, I presented myself at Hask's Horologium with a small bundle of clothing and a copy of Euclid that Mother Greave had given me as a parting gift. My mother embraced me at the door of the shop, her eyes bright with tears she was too proud to shed, and then turned and walked away without looking back. I watched her figure recede down Guildrow until she turned the corner onto Market Street, and then I stepped across the threshold into the next chapter of my life.

I was twelve years old, and I knew nothing of steam or railways, of patents or politics, of rivalry or war. But I knew that I had found my purpose, and I was determined to pursue it with all the energy and persistence that my nature could supply. The years that followed would test that determination severely, but they would also reward it beyond anything I could have imagined on that cold February morning when I first took up the tools of my trade.
