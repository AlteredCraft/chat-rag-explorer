# Chapter 9: Off-World

The path to his mother's chambers wound through the oldest section of Galorum Warren, where the stone had been worn smooth by three centuries of Lurian feet. Morn walked it slowly, his hand trailing along the wall as it had when he was a child. The texture was different now—not rougher, but somehow more familiar, as if his fingers had memorized every depression and ridge without his knowing.

Galenna's door stood open. It always did these days.

He found her in the small garden she'd cultivated in her sitting room, tending to the luminescent moss that grew in shallow basins along the walls. The soft blue glow caught the silver in her skin, the way age had begun to pale her natural coloring. At nearly two hundred and eighty-five, she had entered what Lurians called the Elder phase—still vital, still sharp, but with a stillness that came from having seen enough.

"You're walking like your brother Durvo," she said without turning. "Heavy feet, light purpose."

Morn stopped in the doorway. "I wasn't aware I was walking any particular way."

"That's the problem." Galenna set down her watering vessel and turned to face him. Her eyes, the same deep brown as his own, held the particular quality of maternal perception that had always made lying to her impossible. "Sit. Tell me what's troubling you."

He settled into the chair across from her, the one that had held him through childhood illnesses and adolescent confessions and the quiet conversations of his adult visits. The cushion remembered his shape.

"The Council offered me the *Distant Shore*."

"The new vessel. Captain's position." Galenna nodded slowly. "Torvak mentioned it. He was quite proud."

"He would be."

"And you're not."

Morn was quiet for a long moment. Through the window, he could see the arterial tunnels of the Warren, the constant gentle movement of Lurian life. Families walking. Children playing. Everything continuing as it always had.

"I should be," he said finally. "Twenty years I've worked toward this. Captain of a Galorum vessel. It's everything I was supposed to want."

"Supposed to," Galenna repeated. "A dangerous phrase. It suggests obligation without desire."

"That's not—" Morn stopped. He'd never been able to dissemble with her. "Maybe."

His mother rose from her chair with the careful deliberation of age and crossed to the moss basins. She touched one gently, and its glow intensified for a moment before settling.

"When you were born," she said, "I had seventeen children already. Each one precious. Each one distinct. But I remember thinking, when I held you for the first time, that your eyes were looking for something that wasn't in the room."

"Mother—"

"I've watched you for fifty-five years, Morn. I know when you're content and when you're simply still. These past years, you've been very still."

He looked at his hands. The calluses of two decades of hauling. The small scar on his left palm from a loading accident in his thirties. These hands knew the *Steady Burden* the way they knew his own body.

"I don't know what I want," he admitted. "Just... not this. Not the same routes and the same cargoes and the same family dinners where everyone knows exactly what I'll say before I say it."

"Because you always say what they expect to hear."

"Because I'm good at listening. At fitting in. At being the reliable one." The words came out harder than he intended. "The eighteenth child. The one who doesn't cause problems."

Galenna was silent for a long time. When she spoke again, her voice had changed—softer, more distant, as if she were speaking from somewhere far away.

"Your father was restless too."

Morn looked up sharply. In fifty-five years, he had never heard her mention his father. The topic was closed in the Warren, one of those family silences that everyone honored without discussing. He knew only the bare facts: his father had left before Morn was old enough to remember, had died somewhere off-world, was not to be spoken of.

"He left the Warren young," Galenna continued. "Younger than you. He had the same look in his eyes—that searching quality. He wanted to see what was beyond the trade routes, beyond the familiar spaces. He wanted to matter somewhere that didn't already know his name."

"What happened to him?"

"He died. Some forgotten moon in a system I couldn't point to on a chart. A mining accident, they said, though details were scarce. He was forty-two."

Morn absorbed this. Forty-two. Younger than he was now.

"Is that why no one speaks of him? Because he left?"

"Because speaking of him is painful. Because his choices hurt the family. Because—" Galenna paused, and for the first time, Morn heard a tremor in her voice. "Because I loved him, and he chose distance over us, and I've spent two hundred years understanding that he was not wrong to choose. Only wrong to think choosing was the same as arriving."

She turned to face him, and in the soft glow of the moss, she looked both ancient and ageless.

"Running isn't always wrong, Morn. Sometimes it's necessary. Sometimes the Warren can become a prison even when every door stands open. But know what you're running toward, not just what you're running from. Your father ran from. He never found his toward."

Prenna's healing chambers smelled of the mineral salts she used in her treatments, a scent Morn had associated with comfort since childhood. She was sixty-seven now, no longer the young sister who had bandaged his scrapes, but a senior healer respected throughout the Warren. Yet when she looked at him, he still saw the girl who had stayed up late listening to his troubles.

"You spoke with Mother," she said. It wasn't a question.

"She told me about Father."

Prenna nodded slowly. "I wondered when she would. She's been mentioning him more lately. Age loosens old silences."

"Did you know him?"

"Barely. I was seven when he left. I remember his voice more than his face—deep, like yours. He used to tell stories."

Morn sat on the edge of her examination table, feeling suddenly like a patient awaiting diagnosis. "She thinks I'm like him."

"Are you?"

"I don't know. Maybe. I've been offered the *Distant Shore*, and I should want it, but I don't. I want—" He stopped, frustrated. "I don't know what I want. Just something different. Something that isn't already mapped out."

Prenna set aside the instruments she'd been organizing and sat across from him. Her expression was the same one she wore with difficult patients—gentle, patient, waiting.

"What do you want, Morn? Not what you should want. What do you actually want?"

"To matter. Not as the eighteenth child, not as the reliable hauler, not as the one who fits in." He heard the words as he spoke them, surprised by their honesty. "What if I don't fit anywhere? What if the reason I'm so good at fitting in is because I've never tried to be myself?"

"Then you go find out." Prenna's voice was calm. "You leave. You make mistakes. You discover who you are when there's no one around who already knows."

"And the family?"

"Will survive. Will be hurt. Will eventually understand." She reached out and took his hand. "I've watched you for decades, brother. You've been holding yourself in a shape that isn't quite yours. Maybe it's time to let go and see what shape you naturally take."

The family meeting was Torvak's idea. A formal gathering, he called it, to celebrate Morn's promotion and discuss the future of Galorum shipping. Morn had agreed, knowing what he would have to say, dreading the saying of it.

The great hall held perhaps thirty members of the immediate family—siblings, nieces and nephews, a few cousins. Torvak stood at the head of the table in his administrator's robes, pride radiating from every inch of his ninety-year-old frame. Kellura sat to his right, already calculating shipping schedules in her head. Durvo lounged in a corner, present for once, looking as bored as he always did at family functions.

"Tonight we honor one of our own," Torvak began. "Morn, who has served the Warren faithfully for twenty years, who has earned the trust of every captain he's served under, who now stands ready to take command of the *Distant Shore*—"

"I'm declining."

The silence was immediate and total. Morn felt every eye in the room turn to him, felt the weight of expectation curdling into confusion.

"I'm declining the captaincy," he continued, his voice steadier than he felt. "And I'm leaving the Galorum fleet. I've purchased a ship with my savings. I'm going to strike out independently."

Torvak's face underwent a rapid transformation—confusion to disbelief to hurt, all in the space of seconds. "Morn, this isn't the time for jokes."

"It's not a joke."

"You can't—" Kellura was on her feet, fury already building. "Do you have any idea what we've invested in you? The training, the opportunities, the trust we've placed? You would throw all of that away for what? Some fantasy of independence?"

"It's not a fantasy."

"It's selfishness. Pure, childish selfishness. You've been given everything, and this is how you repay the family?"

Other voices joined in. Questions and objections and the particular Lurian sound of collective disapproval. Morn let it wash over him, keeping his eyes on the table, waiting for the storm to exhaust itself.

When the noise finally subsided, it was Durvo who moved first. He crossed the room with the easy grace of someone who had never cared much for family expectations, and clapped Morn on the shoulder with genuine warmth.

"About time," he said. "I was starting to think you'd never figure it out."

"Figure what out?" Kellura demanded.

"That he's been suffocating here for years. That he's meant for something more than running cargo routes he could navigate in his sleep. That sometimes the best thing a Lurian can do for their family is leave it."

"Spoken like someone who's barely present anyway—"

"Enough." Galenna's voice cut through the argument. She had been sitting quietly in the corner, watching, and now the room fell silent at her word. "Morn has made his choice. We may disagree with it. We may grieve it. But we will respect it."

She rose slowly and crossed to where Morn stood, looking up at him with those ancient, knowing eyes.

"Go," she said quietly, for him alone. "Find what you're looking for. And remember that home will be here when you need it."

The *Patient Ear* sat in the Warren's secondary hangar, small and unassuming among the larger Galorum vessels. Morn had chosen the name himself—a quiet joke, an acknowledgment of the reputation he'd built over twenty years of listening to others' problems.

His cargo hold was full of Lurian trade goods: crystalline formations from the deep caves, processed mineral compounds, the small electronics that Luralis was known for. Enough to establish himself as an independent trader. Enough to start.

He walked the length of his ship slowly, running his hand along the bulkhead as he had along the Warren's ancient walls. This metal was cold, unfamiliar. It would take time to know this vessel the way he'd known the *Steady Burden*.

From the hangar's observation window, he could see the Warren spreading out below—the interconnected tunnels and chambers that had been his entire world for fifty-five years. Somewhere down there, his family was carrying on with their lives. Torvak nursing his hurt. Kellura fuming. Durvo already planning his next departure. Prenna treating patients. Galenna tending her moss in the blue glow of her sitting room.

He did not say goodbye again. He had said enough.

The *Patient Ear* lifted smoothly, responding to his commands with the eagerness of a new vessel. Through the viewscreen, Luralis fell away—brown and gold and utterly familiar. He had seen it from orbit hundreds of times, departing on runs that would bring him back in days or weeks.

This time was different. This time, there was no scheduled return.

Morn set his course for the nearest trading hub, a station three days distant. From there, he would make decisions. Find opportunities. Become whatever he was going to become.

The stars stretched ahead of him, infinite and indifferent.

He had expected to feel free. Instead, he felt weightless in a way that was closer to falling than flying. The Warren's gravity had held him for so long that its absence felt like loss.

But he did not turn back.

He did not look back.

He flew on, alone, into whatever came next.
