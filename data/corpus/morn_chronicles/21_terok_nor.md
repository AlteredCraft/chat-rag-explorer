# Chapter 21: Terok Nor

The station hung in space like a wound that refused to heal.

Morn saw it through the viewport of a Yridian transport—three concentric rings connected by docking pylons, the whole structure rotating slowly against Bajor's ochre surface below. Terok Nor. He'd heard the name in whispered conversations across a dozen stations, always accompanied by the same words: occupation, ore processing, suffering.

He hadn't planned to come here. The Yridian captain had offered passage in exchange for cargo handling, and Morn had stopped asking where ships were going months ago. Anywhere was somewhere. Somewhere was better than nowhere.

The transport docked at an upper pylon. Cardassian security officers waited at the airlock, their gray uniforms and ridged necks giving them the appearance of statues carved from stone. They scanned the Yridian's cargo manifest with obvious disinterest.

"Purpose of visit?" one asked, barely glancing at Morn.

"Cargo handler," the Yridian captain said. "Temporary crew. He's leaving with me."

The Cardassian waved them through.

Morn followed the captain onto the station, and the smell hit him first—recycled air thick with ore dust, machine lubricant, and something else. Something that reminded him of desperation.

The promenade stretched before them, a curved corridor lined with shops and establishments that seemed to huddle against the walls as if afraid of the open space. Bajoran workers moved in shuffling groups, their faces hollow, their eyes fixed on the floor. Cardassian soldiers walked among them like predators through prey, confident in their dominance.

A young Bajoran woman bumped into Morn's shoulder. She flinched backward, her hand flying to the ridges on her nose in an instinctive protective gesture.

"Sorry," she whispered. "I'm sorry."

She was gone before Morn could respond—not that he would have. He watched her disappear into a side corridor, her footsteps quick and afraid.

The Yridian captain conducted his business in three hours. Some negotiation with a Cardassian trader, credits exchanged, cargo transferred. Morn hauled crates and said nothing. When the captain announced they'd be departing, Morn made a decision that surprised even himself.

"I'll stay," he said.

The Yridian blinked his small, dark eyes. "Here? Why would anyone stay here?"

Morn didn't have an answer. Something about the station's oppressive weight felt familiar. Safe, in a twisted way. No one was looking for him here. No one was looking at anyone here except the Cardassians, and they were looking at the Bajorans.

A Lurian with no political affiliations, no connections to the resistance, no value as a hostage or a laborer—he was invisible.

After eighteen months of running, invisibility felt like a gift.

Quark's bar occupied a corner of the promenade like a tumor that had learned to thrive in hostile conditions.

The Ferengi who ran it had large ears even by his species' standards, and a voice that carried across the establishment with practiced precision. He complained about everything—the Cardassian regulations, the Bajoran customers who couldn't pay, the dabo girls who wanted better wages, his brother Rom who apparently couldn't do anything right.

Morn took a seat at the bar on his third day on the station. He ordered a Slug-o-Cola because it was cheap. He said nothing else.

Quark served him with barely a glance. "First time here? Don't cause trouble. The Cardassians have no sense of humor, and I can't afford to lose another customer to their interrogation rooms."

Morn nodded.

"You're a Lurian," Quark continued, polishing a glass with mechanical efficiency. "Don't see many of you out here. Running from something?"

Morn said nothing.

"Smart. Don't tell me. I don't want to know." Quark set the glass down and leaned against the bar. "Everyone here is running from something. The trick is not to run so fast that you draw attention."

It was good advice. Morn appreciated that Quark hadn't expected a response.

He finished his drink, paid in credit chips he'd saved from the Yridian job, and left. The next day, he came back. And the day after that.

---

The station's routine became his own.

Morn found work as a local hauler—small jobs moving cargo between the docking ring and the promenade merchants. The pay was minimal, but it covered his bar tabs and a small quarters on the habitat ring. The Cardassians barely noticed him. The Bajorans had too many of their own problems.

He watched the occupation unfold in small, terrible details.

A Bajoran man beaten in the corridor for walking too slowly. A child crying for her mother outside the ore processing center. Cardassian laughter echoing through the promenade after some cruelty Morn couldn't see. The station's air recyclers working constantly to scrub the dust from the mining operations, and never quite succeeding.

Morn observed it all. He said nothing.

What could he say? What could anyone say? The occupation was a machine, grinding forward with mechanical indifference, and speaking against it meant disappearing into interrogation rooms from which people rarely returned.

He wasn't a hero. He'd never been a hero. He was a Lurian who'd spent his life trying to find somewhere to belong, and now he was trying to survive.

At night, in his small quarters, he lay awake and listened to the station's sounds—the hum of the reactors, the distant clang of ore processing, the occasional shout from Cardassian patrols. He thought about the heist, about Hain and the others, about the latinum sitting heavy in his secondary stomach.

The thoughts came less frequently now.

---

"You know what I can't stand?" Quark said one evening, apropos of nothing. "Customers who complain about the prices. Do they think I'm running a charity? Do they think the Cardassians let me operate out of the goodness of their hearts?"

Morn sat at his usual spot, nursing a drink he'd been working on for an hour.

"I have to pay bribes to six different officials just to keep this place open," Quark continued. "Six! And that's not counting the informal 'gifts' that Gul Dukat expects whenever he decides to grace us with his presence." He spat the name like a curse. "The man thinks he's Bajor's savior. Ask the Bajorans what they think of their savior."

Morn said nothing. He didn't need to. Quark was talking at him, not to him, filling the silence with grievances because that's what Quark did.

"My brother Rom—have I mentioned my brother?—he thinks I should be grateful. 'At least we have a business, Quark. At least we're not in the mines.' As if that's a standard to aspire to. 'At least we're not being worked to death.' Some ambition."

A Cardassian officer entered the bar, and Quark's demeanor shifted instantly. His complaints vanished, replaced by an obsequious smile.

"Glinn Boheeka! Welcome, welcome. Your usual table is waiting."

Morn watched the transformation with detached interest. Survival meant wearing masks. He understood that better than most.

---

Weeks passed. Then months.

Morn's routine solidified into something approaching permanence. He hauled cargo in the mornings, drank at Quark's in the evenings, and avoided the ore processing levels where the worst of the occupation's cruelty was concentrated. He learned which Cardassians to avoid, which Bajoran merchants would sell to him without resentment, which corridors were safe at which hours.

He learned that invisibility required maintenance.

"You're here again," Quark observed one night, as if Morn hadn't been coming to the same seat for six months. "Don't you have anywhere else to be?"

Morn shook his head.

"Neither do I." Quark poured himself a drink—against his own rules about sampling the merchandise—and leaned against the bar. "You know what I realized yesterday? I've been on this station for four years. Four years in this... pit. I told myself it was temporary. Build up some capital, then move on to bigger opportunities. Better markets."

He drank, his large ears drooping slightly.

"Now I can't imagine leaving. Isn't that pathetic? I've adapted to this place. Like some kind of... what do humans call them? Lichen. I've become lichen."

Morn made a sound that might have been sympathetic.

"Not that you'd understand. You Lurians, you're like rocks. You just sit there, and nothing seems to affect you. I envy that, sometimes." Quark straightened, composing himself. "Don't tell anyone I said that. Bad for my image."

Morn wouldn't tell anyone. He had no one to tell.

But something in the exchange settled into him like warmth. Quark talked to him—at him, around him, through him—but it was still conversation. Still connection. The first real connection he'd had since walking away from Hain and the others.

He didn't acknowledge it. Neither did Quark.

Some things were better left unnamed.

The seasons on Bajor changed, visible through the station's viewports as shifts in the planet's cloud patterns. Morn had been on Terok Nor for nearly a year.

One evening, he sat at the bar while Quark counted the day's earnings and complained about counterfeit currency. A Bajoran woman sang somewhere in the back of the establishment—a mournful melody that the Cardassian patrons ignored but that made the Bajoran servers pause in their work, their eyes distant with grief.

Morn listened to the song. He didn't understand the words, but he understood the emotion. Loss. Longing. The ache for something that had been taken.

"Depressing, isn't it?" Quark said quietly. "That song. It's about Bajor before the occupation. The farmers in the provinces, the festivals, all that pastoral nonsense." He shook his head. "They sing it every time the Cardassians aren't paying attention. Dangerous, if you ask me. But try telling a Bajoran not to do something. They're almost as stubborn as Lurians."

The song ended. The bar's normal sounds resumed—the clink of glasses, the chatter of customers, the spin of the dabo wheel.

Morn finished his drink and realized something.

He hadn't thought about the heist crew in weeks. Not about Hain's steady hands, not about Krit and Nahsk's bickering, not about Larell's smile. Not about the latinum burning in his stomach like a secret.

The memories were still there, of course. They'd always be there. But they'd faded from urgent to background, from active pain to old scar.

Maybe that was what healing felt like. Not forgetting, but... quieting.

He looked around the bar—at the Cardassians in their uniforms, at the Bajorans in their careful servitude, at Quark polishing glasses and muttering about profit margins. None of them knew his name. None of them knew his history. To them, he was just the quiet Lurian who sat at the bar and never caused trouble.

Invisible. Anonymous. Safe.

"Same time tomorrow?" Quark asked as Morn stood to leave.

Morn nodded.

"Good. You're one of the few customers I don't actively despise. Don't let that go to your head."

Morn walked back to his quarters through the station's dim corridors. Bajoran workers shuffled past him, their eyes on the floor. A Cardassian patrol marched by, their boots echoing on the metal deck. The ore processors hummed in the distance, never stopping, never resting.

Terok Nor was a terrible place. A monument to cruelty, a machine for suffering.

But somewhere in its grim corridors, Morn had found what he'd been searching for since he walked away from the heist. Not happiness—the station didn't offer happiness. Not redemption—he hadn't done enough to earn that.

Peace.

The quiet, weary peace of a man who had finally stopped running.

He reached his quarters and stood at the viewport, looking out at Bajor's surface glowing in the starlight. Somewhere down there, millions of people lived under occupation, their world stolen from them. Somewhere out there, his former crew might still be searching for him, or might have given up long ago.

None of it touched him here. Nothing touched him here.

Maybe, Morn thought as he watched the planet turn slowly below, this was home.

Not the home he'd imagined. Not the home he'd wanted.

But home nonetheless.
