# Chapter 14: Reputation

The Bolian freighter captain had been talking for three hours.

Morn sat across from him in a private booth at Qualar's, a transit hub cantina on the edge of the Cardassian border, nursing his third synthale and nodding at appropriate intervals. The captain—a nervous man named Prell who kept touching the ridges on his face as if checking they were still there—was confessing to something that could get him executed on six worlds.

"—and I knew the manifest was falsified, but what was I supposed to do? The Cardassians have quotas, and if you don't meet quotas, they find someone who will. So I looked the other way. Seventeen shipments. Seventeen." Prell's voice cracked. "I didn't know what they were transporting. I swear I didn't know."

Morn knew. Everyone in the gray markets knew. Prell had been moving Cardassian military supplies through neutral space, disguised as agricultural equipment. The fact that those supplies had ended up on Setlik III was something Prell was only now piecing together, years after the massacre.

"I can't sleep," Prell continued. "Every time I close my eyes, I see—" He stopped, pressing his palms against the table. "You're the only person I've told. In fifteen years, you're the only one."

Morn reached across and patted the captain's hand. Then he launched into a story about a similar moral quandary he'd once faced—entirely fabricated, of course, but emotionally true enough that Prell's shoulders began to unknot.

By the time Morn finished, the Bolian was nodding along, extracting what absolution he could from the tale. They talked for another hour about cargo routes and fuel prices and whether the Klingons would honor their new treaty. When Prell finally left, he pressed a credit chip into Morn's palm with trembling gratitude.

Morn sat alone in the booth for a long time afterward.

*Morn talks, Morn listens, Morn doesn't repeat.*

He'd heard the phrase for the first time about five years ago, whispered between two Andorian smugglers who didn't realize he was within earshot. Since then, it had followed him across the quadrant like a title he'd never sought.

The reputation was accurate, as far as it went. Morn did talk—endlessly, enthusiastically, about anything and everything. He talked about engine specifications and popular holonovels, about the mating habits of Risian tree-crabs and the proper fermentation of Aldebaran whiskey. He talked so much that people assumed he had no room for secrets, no capacity for deception. After all, how could someone who shared everything be hiding anything?

But Morn listened too. He listened to the things people couldn't tell anyone else. Confessions, regrets, business plans, betrayals. He'd heard dying wishes and murder plots, love declarations and suicide contemplations. People talked to him because his flood of words made them feel safe—like dropping a pebble into a roaring river. Whatever they said would be swept away, lost in the current of Morn's chatter.

And he didn't repeat. That part was the most important, and the most exhausting. Morn carried secrets like cargo—carefully catalogued, precisely stored, never to be unloaded without permission. He knew things about people that would destroy careers, end marriages, start wars. He knew which Ferengi DaiMon was skimming from his own family, which Bajoran resistance cell leader had once collaborated with the Cardassians, which Federation ambassador had a taste for substances banned on a dozen worlds.

He carried it all. And he told no one.

The weight of it was something Morn hadn't anticipated when he'd first realized people were willing to pay for his discretion. In the early years, the secrets had felt like currency—valuable commodities that enhanced his worth in the gray markets. But decades accumulated. The confessions piled up. And Morn found himself drowning in other people's truths while his own remained locked away where no one could reach them.

He'd never told anyone about his kelvu's capacity. Not really.

Oh, people knew he had a secondary stomach—it was common knowledge among Lurians, a physiological trait their species had evolved for storing liquid nourishment during long desert crossings on their homeworld. But no one knew how much Morn could actually hold. Not his parents, who had died assuming their son was merely average in all respects. Not Hain, who probably suspected but had never been given confirmation. Not even the various doctors who had examined Morn over the decades—he'd learned early how to control his internal musculature, presenting scan results that showed a modestly sized kelvu rather than the remarkably expanded chamber he actually possessed.

It was, he sometimes thought, his only true secret. Everything else about him was performed, calculated, deliberately constructed. But this—this one piece of biological truth—belonged to him alone.

The loneliness of it was suffocating.

Morn finished his synthale and ordered another, watching the cantina's evening crowd cycle through its rituals. Traders haggling, pilots bragging, lovers arguing in corners where they thought no one could see. Everyone performing their own version of connection while he sat apart, knowing too much about too many to ever fully join.

His comm unit chimed. A message from Larell: *My quarters. 2100 hours. Bring something sweet.*

Morn smiled—a genuine expression, one of the few he allowed himself anymore—and left credits on the table.

---

Larell's quarters on Station Koma were small but immaculately organized, every surface serving double duty as storage. She'd learned to live light, ready to relocate on short notice. It was one of many survival skills she'd honed over her years working for Hain.

When Morn arrived with a box of Delavian chocolates—rare, expensive, her absolute favorite—she answered the door in a simple robe, her dark hair still wet from the shower. The smile she gave him reached her eyes, which was how Morn knew the evening wasn't about business.

"You remembered," she said, taking the chocolates and pulling him inside.

"You mentioned them once. Three years ago. Something about your grandmother teaching you how to temper the coating."

Larell laughed, shaking her head. "That memory of yours. It's almost unsettling."

"Only almost?"

She kissed him instead of answering, and for a while, neither of them needed to talk at all.

Later, they lay tangled together in her narrow bed, the chocolates half-eaten on the nightstand. Larell traced idle patterns on Morn's chest while he stared at the ceiling, feeling the familiar post-intimacy melancholy settling over him like fog.

"You're thinking too loud," Larell murmured.

"Occupational hazard."

She propped herself up on one elbow, studying his face with those remarkable eyes—dark, intelligent, seeing more than he wanted her to. "What do you think about? When you're not talking?"

It was a question no one had ever asked him. Morn considered deflecting with a joke, a story, a redirection toward lighter territory. But something about the darkness, the warmth of her against him, the strange intimacy of the moment, made him answer honestly.

"Secrets," he said. "Other people's secrets. They pile up. Sometimes I feel like I'm disappearing under them."

Larell was quiet for a long moment. Then she said, "Do you ever want to tell someone? Put down some of the weight?"

"There's no one I could tell. Not without breaking trust that was given to me." He turned to look at her. "What about you? You must carry things. Working for Hain, doing what you do."

Her expression flickered—something passing through it too quickly for even Morn to read. "I try not to carry anything. Makes it easier to walk away when I need to."

"Does it work?"

"No." She laid her head on his chest again, and he felt her sigh against his skin. "I carry you, Morn. Whether I want to or not."

He wrapped an arm around her, pulling her closer, and they lay in silence for a time that felt suspended from the usual flow of moments. This was what he'd been missing, Morn realized. This was what all the talking and listening couldn't provide—someone who saw him, not as a repository for secrets or a conduit for information, but simply as a person. Flawed, lonely, desperately seeking connection.

He loved her. He'd known it for months, maybe years. He'd never said it aloud.

"Hain has a job," Larell said eventually, her voice carefully neutral. "A big one. Bigger than anything he's planned before."

The warmth in Morn's chest went cold. "How big?"

"Big enough that he's been working on it for years. Big enough that he wants you involved from the beginning."

Morn stared at the ceiling again, processing. Hain's "big jobs" had always been ambitious—high-risk, high-reward operations that required precision timing and absolute discretion. But the phrase "years in planning" suggested something on an entirely different scale.

"What's the target?"

"I don't know the details. Hain keeps things compartmentalized until he's ready." Larell shifted against him. "I know he values you. Values what you can do. He says you have a gift for carrying things."

The words sent a chill down Morn's spine. Did Hain know? Had he figured out the truth about the kelvu? Or was he speaking generally, about Morn's reputation for discretion?

"I don't know if I want to be part of something that big," Morn said slowly. "The risk-reward calculation—"

"I'm not pushing." Larell sat up, the sheet falling away from her shoulders. "Hain told me to mention it. That's all. Whatever you decide, I'll still be here."

But she wouldn't be, Morn thought. That was the nature of their world. People stayed until they didn't, until circumstances or survival instincts or better opportunities pulled them away. Larell belonged to Hain's organization first, to her own survival second, and to Morn only in whatever space remained after those priorities were satisfied.

He knew this. He'd known it from the beginning. And yet.

"What would you do?" he asked. "If you were me?"

Larell considered the question with the seriousness it deserved. "I would ask myself what I was holding out for. What future I thought I was protecting by saying no." She reached for a chocolate, bit into it, chewed thoughtfully. "You've been in the gray markets for decades, Morn. You're good at what you do. But you're alone. You'll always be alone if you keep playing it safe."

"And if I take the risk?"

"Then maybe you won't be. Maybe you'll finally belong somewhere. To something." She paused. "To someone."

It was manipulation. Morn recognized it as such—Larell was too skilled not to know exactly which buttons she was pressing. But recognition didn't immunize him. The loneliness she'd named was real. The desire for belonging was real. And the love he felt for her, complicated and compromised as it was, was the realest thing in his life.

"I want to hear the plan," he said.

Larell's smile was slow, satisfied, and just a little sad—as if she'd hoped he would say no. "I'll tell Hain."

She kissed him again, and Morn kissed back, and neither of them spoke about what he'd just agreed to. There would be time for that later. Time for details and logistics and the careful calculation of risks.

For now, there was only this—two people pretending they could trust each other, while the future waited patient and inexorable in the darkness outside.

---

Three days later, Morn received coordinates for a meeting.

He sat alone in his ship, staring at the numbers, feeling the weight of every secret he'd ever carried pressing down on his shoulders. Somewhere in his kelvu, the capacity for something terrible waited to be filled.

*Morn talks, Morn listens, Morn doesn't repeat.*

Soon, he would have something of his own to keep silent about. Something that would follow him for the rest of his life.

He entered the coordinates and set course.
