# Chapter 26: Wartime

The war announced itself in whispers before it arrived in weapons fire.

Morn noticed the changes the way one notices the tide going out—gradually, then all at once. More warships docking at the station. More officers speaking in hushed voices over untouched drinks. More civilians booking passage to anywhere else. The wormhole, that magnificent flower of light he'd watched bloom thousands of times, now seemed less like a doorway and more like a wound that wouldn't close.

By early 2373, the bar had taken on a different character. The laughter came quicker, louder, more desperate. People drank faster. They tipped better. Quark noticed the profit margin improving and said nothing about why.

"You ever think about leaving?" Quark asked one evening, wiping down a glass that was already clean. The bar was quiet—unusual for this hour. Half the usual crowd had shipped out on the last transport to Bajor.

Morn looked at his stool, worn smooth by years of sitting. He looked at the bar, at the bottles arranged just so, at the dabo wheel spinning its endless circles. He looked at Quark, who was pretending not to be afraid.

He shook his head.

"Didn't think so," Quark said. "Neither am I. But I've got latinum hidden in seventeen different locations on this station, just in case. You should probably do the same."

Morn almost smiled. If only Quark knew.

The last months before the occupation passed in a blur of mobilizations and meetings. Starfleet officers came and went with increasing urgency. The Defiant launched on missions no one talked about. Morn watched Captain Sisko's face grow more lined, more haunted, with each passing week. The man carried the weight of prophecy and war simultaneously. Morn knew something about carrying weight.

The station's population thinned. Families left first, then merchants who could relocate, then anyone with somewhere else to be. Those who remained fell into two categories: those who couldn't leave and those who wouldn't.

Morn was firmly in the second camp, though he let people assume the first.

The day the Dominion came, Morn was exactly where he always was.

The evacuation happened fast—Starfleet had planned for this contingency. Morn watched through the bar's windows as officers rushed past, as the last Federation ships prepared to depart. Major Kira appeared briefly, shouting something about staying behind, about resistance. Chief O'Brien ran past with equipment bundled in his arms. Commander Dax moved with that particular Trill grace, even in crisis.

Captain Sisko stopped at the bar's entrance. Just for a moment. His eyes found Morn.

"Keep the stool warm," he said. It might have been a joke. It might have been an order. It might have been a prayer.

Then he was gone, and the blue uniforms gave way to gray armor, and the Jem'Hadar walked onto Deep Space 9 as if they owned it.

Which, for now, they did.

The first days of occupation were the strangest. The Jem'Hadar patrolled in silence, their cold eyes registering everything and reacting to nothing. They didn't drink, didn't gamble, didn't participate in any commerce beyond violence. They simply watched and waited for reasons to kill.

Quark adapted with the flexibility of a born survivor. The bar stayed open. The dabo wheel kept spinning. The drinks kept flowing—though the clientele had changed dramatically. Cardassian officers now occupied the best seats. Dominion administrators moved through the Promenade with bureaucratic purpose. The few remaining civilians kept their heads down and their opinions silent.

Morn sat on his stool and observed.

It was, he realized, the only form of resistance available to him. He sat where he had always sat. He drank what he had always drunk. He maintained the rhythm of a life that the Dominion could occupy but not erase. Every morning he took his place, and every night he yielded it reluctantly. He was a monument to normalcy in a station that had forgotten what normal meant.

The other survivors noticed. A nod here, a brief meeting of eyes there. *You're still here*, their looks said. *So are we*. It wasn't much. But it was something.

Weyoun came to the bar exactly once.

The Vorta administrator swept in with his security detail on a Thursday evening—Morn had been keeping careful track of the days, afraid that losing count would mean losing himself. Weyoun examined the establishment with the pleasant curiosity of a tourist, commenting on the architecture, the selection of beverages, the quality of the dabo girls' smiles.

He ordered a drink he didn't touch. He asked Quark questions he already knew the answers to. He moved through the room like a man who owned not just the station but everyone in it.

Then he stopped in front of Morn.

"Ah," Weyoun said, his voice silk over steel. "The famous barfly. I've read about you in the station records. Quite the fixture, aren't you?"

Morn met his eyes.

They were the kindest eyes he had ever seen on the cruelest face he had ever encountered. The Vorta's smile was perfect—genetically engineered for persuasion, for false comfort, for the administration of atrocity with a pleasant demeanor. Behind that smile was something that had never known doubt, never questioned orders, never lost a moment's sleep over the billions who would die in the Dominion's name.

Morn had met murderers in his courier days. He had known criminals and killers and people who had done terrible things for profit or passion. All of them had been, in their way, comprehensible. They were broken in ways that Morn could understand.

Weyoun wasn't broken. He was built. Built to serve, to smile, to oversee genocide with the efficiency of a well-designed machine.

Morn looked into those kind, terrible eyes and saw nothing he wanted to understand.

"Not very talkative, are you?" Weyoun said, his smile never wavering. "That's probably wise. The quiet ones tend to survive longest in times like these."

Then he was gone, and Morn realized his hands were shaking. He gripped his glass until the trembling stopped. He didn't leave his stool.

The occupation lasted months. Morn watched Kira play her dangerous games of resistance. He watched Quark navigate impossible situations with his particular brand of cowardly courage. He watched Rom transform from a nobody into someone who mattered. He watched Odo struggle with loyalties that should have been simple but weren't.

He didn't help. He didn't hinder. He sat and watched and waited.

The question gnawed at him in the long nights. Should he do more? He had resources—more latinum than the entire Bajoran treasury, hidden in a place no one would think to look. He had skills—decades of courier work had taught him things about moving through dangerous territory, avoiding detection, delivering packages that couldn't be traced. He had connections, old contacts who might still honor old debts.

He could have done something. Funded the resistance. Run supplies. Used his unremarkable appearance to carry messages past Dominion security.

He did nothing.

Was it wisdom or cowardice? Age or exhaustion? Prudence or paralysis?

Morn never found an answer that satisfied him. He was old. He was tired. He wasn't a soldier, had never been a soldier, had spent forty years avoiding violence whenever possible. The war asked him to become someone he had never been, and he couldn't do it.

So he sat. He watched. He survived.

And he wondered, in the darkest hours, if survival was enough.

The liberation came in fire and chaos.

Operation Return hit the station like a thunderclap. Morn was at his stool—where else would he be?—when the first explosions shook the Promenade. Through the bar's windows, he saw Starfleet security teams advancing, exchanging fire with Jem'Hadar soldiers. He saw phaser beams and disruptor blasts crisscrossing the air. He saw people running, screaming, dying.

He dove behind the bar with Quark and the few customers who hadn't fled. They huddled there while the battle raged meters away. Glass shattered. The dabo wheel took a stray shot and collapsed. Something heavy fell somewhere, and the lights flickered and failed.

In the darkness, Morn heard Quark praying—actually praying, promising the Blessed Exchequer anything if they survived this. He heard the thunder of boots, the hiss of weapons, the cries of the wounded. He smelled smoke and blood and ozone.

Then, suddenly, it was quiet.

When Morn finally raised his head above the bar, Captain Sisko was standing in the entrance. The man was battered, dirty, triumphant. Behind him, Federation uniforms moved through the Promenade, securing positions, treating wounded, reclaiming their home.

Sisko's eyes found Morn.

"Stool's still warm," Morn said. His voice sounded strange to his own ears—he hadn't used it in months.

Sisko laughed. It was the laugh of a man released from unbearable tension, joy and exhaustion and relief all mixed together. "Good man," he said, and moved on to the thousand other things that needed his attention.

Morn reclaimed his seat. The bar was half destroyed, but his stool had survived. He sat on it and watched the Federation return, and tried to feel something other than numb.

The war didn't end with the liberation. It dragged on for another year, a grinding conflict that consumed ships and soldiers and hope across the entire quadrant. The station became a staging ground, a hospital, a morgue. Ships launched for battle and sometimes returned. People came and went, and some of the ones who went never came back.

The bar remained open. Quark repaired the damage, restocked the shelves, resumed operations with his characteristic determination. Business was better than ever—people needed to drink, needed to forget, needed somewhere to go that wasn't their quarters or the infirmary or the cold silence of space.

Morn listened.

That was his function now. He sat on his stool, and people told him things. An ensign whose entire graduating class had been killed at Chin'toka. A Bajoran whose family had survived the occupation only to lose three sons in the subsequent fighting. A Starfleet captain who made decisions that sent hundreds to their deaths and couldn't stop seeing their faces.

They came to Morn because he listened without judgment. Because he never offered advice or platitudes. Because his silence gave them permission to speak the unspeakable—the grief, the rage, the guilt, the terrible relief of still being alive when so many weren't.

He absorbed their pain the way the bar absorbed the noise of a hundred conversations. He didn't do anything with it. He just held it, kept it company, made sure no one had to carry their burden entirely alone.

It wasn't heroic. It wasn't resistance. It was just what he could do.

The war ended on a Tuesday.

Word came through the station like wildfire—the Dominion had surrendered. The Treaty of Bajor would be signed within hours. After two years of constant warfare, millions of casualties, the destruction of entire worlds, it was over.

The bar erupted.

Everyone who could walk crowded onto the Promenade. Drinks were poured and spilled and poured again. People embraced strangers. Someone started singing, badly, and others joined in. The dabo girls threw their arms around anyone nearby. Quark tried to charge for the celebratory drinks and gave up when Rom threatened to tell their mother.

Morn raised his glass with everyone else.

He didn't cheer. He couldn't. Too many ghosts stood between him and joy—all the people who had sat at this bar and poured out their grief, all the names he'd heard whispered and sobbed and screamed in the long months of war. The dead didn't care about treaties. The dead would stay dead forever.

But he was still here.

He had sat on this stool through peace and war, through occupation and liberation, through the worst conflict the quadrant had ever seen. He hadn't fought. He hadn't resisted. He hadn't done anything heroic or memorable or worthy of the history books.

He had simply refused to leave.

Around him, the celebration roared on. Victory songs and grateful tears. Relieved laughter and tight embraces. The sound of a station remembering what hope felt like.

Morn drank his drink in silence. He thought about all the people who wouldn't be drinking tonight. He thought about the questions he would never be able to answer—about duty and cowardice, about action and endurance, about what he owed to a galaxy at war.

He thought about the latinum in his stomach, all that wealth doing nothing while the quadrant burned.

He thought about being old, and tired, and still here when so many others weren't.

The war was over. The bar was open. Morn sat on his stool, surrounded by celebration, and felt something that might have been relief, or might have been grief, or might have been nothing at all.

He was still here.

For now, that would have to be enough.
