# The Morn Chronicles

A novel-length fan fiction exploring the life of Morn, the beloved Lurian bar patron from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.

## About This Corpus

This corpus was created as demonstration data for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. It combines elements from an established universe that exists in LLM training data (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) with entirely original narrative content that does not exist in training data.

### Why Morn?

Morn is the perfect subject for this project:

- **Blank Slate Character**: Appears in over 90 DS9 episodes but never speaks a word on screen
- **Canon Irony**: Other characters constantly reference what a chatterbox he is—we never see it
- **Unexplored Biology**: Lurians are barely defined in canon, allowing creative worldbuilding
- **Minimal Existing Fiction**: Protagonist-focused Morn stories are rare in the fan fiction landscape
- **Long Lifespan**: Canon suggests Lurians live for centuries, enabling an epic scope
- **Perfect Connections**: As Quark's most loyal customer, Morn witnessed all of DS9's major events

### RAG Testing Value

This corpus enables testing whether a RAG system can:
- Retrieve invented lore (Lurian culture) that contradicts no training data
- Distinguish between canon facts and original fiction
- Answer questions about narrative events not in any training set
- Handle queries mixing canon (DS9 events) with original content (Morn's perspective)

## Story Overview

**The Morn Chronicles** follows Morn from his birth as the eighteenth child in a Lurian warren-family, through his coming of age, his years as an independent courier, the infamous Lissepian Mother's Day Heist, and finally his arrival at the station that would become his home: Deep Space 9.

- **Length**: ~60,000 words across 28 chapters
- **Tone**: Dramedy—serious backstory balanced with Trek-appropriate humor
- **Rating**: Family-friendly, suitable for all ages
- **Focus**: 70% Lurian worldbuilding / 30% DS9-era events
- **Style**: Third person, past tense, chronological
