# Chapter 15: The Crew Assembles

The safehouse occupied the third floor of a decommissioned water treatment facility on Korva Minor, a neutral world whose principal industry was looking the other way. Morn climbed the service stairs through the smell of rust and chemical residue, each step echoing in the vertical shaft like a countdown.

Twenty-three years since that first dinner at the Velvet Nebula. Twenty-three years of jobs and favors and carefully cultivated trust. His joints ached in ways they hadn't when he'd been a young Lurian running salvage through the Denorios Belt. His face had settled into deeper folds, his coloring had shifted from amber to a weathered bronze. He was one hundred forty-nine years old—not old for a Lurian, but old enough to feel the weight of every compromise he'd ever made.

The door at the top of the stairs was unremarkable: gray metal, no markings. But Morn noticed the barely visible sensor array embedded in the frame, the way the hinges were reinforced to withstand a battering ram. Hain's attention to detail had always been impeccable.

He pressed his palm to the scanner. The door slid open.

The room beyond had been transformed from industrial decay into something approaching comfort. Heavy curtains blocked the windows, atmospheric processors hummed quietly in the corners, and a long table dominated the center of the space, covered in PADDs, architectural schematics, and what appeared to be genuine paper maps. Real paper. The kind that couldn't be remotely accessed or erased.

Hain stood at the head of the table, and he smiled when Morn entered—that familiar smile that had welcomed him into a thousand rooms over two decades.

"Morn. Right on time, as always."

The years had touched Hain lightly. A few more lines around the eyes, perhaps, a slight silver threading through the dark hair at his temples. But the same easy charm, the same controlled grace in every movement. Looking at him now, Morn realized he still didn't know what species Hain actually was. In twenty-three years, he'd never asked. Hain had a way of making such questions feel irrelevant.

"The others?" Morn asked.

"On their way. Sit. There's kanar if you want it—I know it's not your first choice, but it's what we have."

Morn settled into one of the chairs arranged around the table, declining the drink. His kelvu had been bothering him lately, an uncomfortable fullness that had nothing to do with food. Stress, probably. Or prescience.

The door opened again, and Larell walked in.

She'd changed too, though Morn would never have said so to her face. The wild energy of her youth had refined into something sharper, more focused. She moved differently now—less like someone who wanted to be noticed and more like someone who knew exactly how to deploy attention as a weapon. Her hair was shorter, practical, and she'd added a small scar above her left eyebrow that somehow made her more beautiful.

Their eyes met. That old current passed between them, the accumulated charge of a relationship that had never quite resolved into anything stable. They'd been together, apart, together again—a pattern as predictable as orbital mechanics and just as inescapable.

"Morn." She slid into the chair beside him, close enough that their arms almost touched. "You look tired."

"I am tired."

"Mmm." Her hand found his under the table, squeezed briefly. "After this, we can be tired together."

The door opened a third time, and Krit and Nahsk entered simultaneously—which was the only way Morn had ever seen them do anything. The twins were massive, easily two meters tall, with shoulders that seemed designed specifically for doorway navigation. Their species had never been identified to Morn's satisfaction; they had the general humanoid configuration but their skin had a greyish, almost geological quality, and their eyes were set slightly too far apart for comfort.

They took positions flanking the door, standing rather than sitting, arms crossed. Krit—or maybe Nahsk; Morn had never been able to tell them apart—grunted in acknowledgment. The other one didn't bother.

"Muscle," Larell murmured near Morn's ear. "Hain picked them up on Farius Prime about five years back. They're loyal as targ hounds and about as clever."

"I heard that," one of the twins said.

"I know you did, darling. It wasn't a secret."

Hain cleared his throat, drawing all attention back to the head of the table. "Now that we're all here, I think it's time I explained why I've been asking so much of all of you over the past few years."

He touched a control, and a holographic display flickered to life above the table's center. A building materialized in blue light: massive, ornate, all curved surfaces and reinforced angles. The architecture was distinctly Lissepian—organic forms rendered in defensive materials.

"The Central Bank of Lissepia," Hain said. "Arguably the most secure financial institution in this sector. Definitely the most lucrative."

Morn felt his kelvu contract involuntarily. He'd heard rumors, of course. Everyone in the gray markets had heard rumors about the Central Bank. It was the kind of target people joked about in bars, knowing no one would ever be foolish enough to actually attempt it.

"One thousand bricks of gold-pressed latinum," Hain continued, "currently stored in the primary vault. Their complete reserve. The foundation of the Lissepian currency system."

"That's insane," Morn heard himself say. "The security alone—"

"Is considerable," Hain agreed. "Under normal circumstances. But circumstances, my friend, are about to become very much not normal." He touched another control, and the display shifted to show a calendar. "Lissepian Mother's Day. Fourteen months from now. It's their most sacred holiday—the entire culture essentially shuts down for forty-eight hours. Including, crucially, most of the bank's security staff."

"They still have automated systems," Larell said. She was leaning forward, studying the display with professional interest. "Force fields, sensors, the works."

"Which is where Krit and Nahsk come in." Hain nodded toward the twins. "They've spent the last three years cultivating contacts in the Lissepian security industry. When the time comes, they'll have access to the maintenance protocols for every system in that building."

One of the twins—Morn decided to think of him as Krit—nodded slowly. "We know a guy who knows a guy who programs the fields. He owes us."

"He owes you," his brother corrected. "I'm the one who broke his fingers."

"Same thing."

Hain continued as if this exchange hadn't happened. "Larell will handle the social engineering. The bank's director has certain... vulnerabilities. She'll ensure we have legitimate access to the building on the day in question."

"He likes Boslic women," Larell said matter-of-factly. "I can be a Boslic woman."

Morn turned to look at her. "You're not Boslic."

"I can be anyone I need to be, Morn. You know that."

He did know that. It was one of the things that had always unsettled him about her, even as it drew him closer.

"So we have access and disabled security," Morn said slowly. "But a thousand bricks of latinum—that's not something you just walk out with. It weighs tons. Literally tons. How do we extract it?"

Hain's smile widened slightly. "That's the elegant part. We don't take the bricks. We take what's inside them."

The display shifted again, showing a cross-section of a standard gold-pressed latinum brick. The gold casing, the liquid latinum core.

"We extract the latinum, leave the gold. By the time anyone realizes the bricks are worthless shells, we'll be three sectors away."

"You'd still need containers," Morn pressed. "Specialized equipment. All of that leaves a trail."

"It would," Hain agreed. "If we were using containers."

Something in his tone made Morn's kelvu clench again. Beside him, Larell's hand found his once more, but this time the gesture felt less like affection and more like preparation.

"This is where you come in, Morn." Hain's eyes met his across the holographic display. "You've been wondering, I think, why I've kept you so close all these years. Why I've invested so much in our friendship."

The word friendship landed wrong, somehow. Off-key.

"You're Lurian," Hain continued. "And Lurians have a very particular physiological gift. A second stomach—what your people call the kelvu. Originally evolved for food storage during long migrations, but remarkably adaptable to other purposes."

Morn felt the blood drain from his face. "How do you know about—"

"I've known since the beginning," Hain said gently, almost apologetically. "Since before that first dinner at the Velvet Nebula. You were recommended to me, Morn. Specifically because of your biology."

The room seemed to contract around him. Twenty-three years. Every job, every favor, every conversation that had felt like genuine connection—all of it leading to this moment. He'd been cultivated. Groomed. Selected for a purpose he was only now discovering.

"The kelvu can hold approximately one hundred liters of liquid," Hain continued, clinical now. "Based on my research, that's enough capacity for almost all of the liquid latinum from a thousand bricks—assuming we pack efficiently. You'll fly it out yourself, in your ship, through normal customs checkpoints. No special containers. No suspicious cargo. Just a Lurian with a stomachache flying home from a business trip."

Morn stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. The twins shifted at the door, subtle threat in their massive frames.

"You used me," Morn said. "All this time—"

"I cultivated a business relationship," Hain corrected. "One that will make you unimaginably wealthy. We're talking about two hundred bricks' worth as your share, Morn. Enough to buy your own moon. Enough to never run cargo again. Enough to live however you want, wherever you want, with whoever you want."

His eyes flicked to Larell, and Morn followed the glance. She was watching him with an expression he couldn't quite read—hope and guilt and something that might have been genuine feeling, all tangled together.

"I didn't know," she said quietly. "About the kelvu. I didn't know until tonight."

Morn wanted to believe her. The terrible thing was, he wasn't sure it mattered whether she was telling the truth.

"Even if I agreed," he said slowly, "the kelvu isn't—it's not just a storage tank. It's part of me. Having that much foreign material inside me for however long it takes to move it safely..."

"It will be uncomfortable," Hain acknowledged. "Possibly dangerous. I won't lie to you about that."

"And you'll have to lose the ability to speak," Larell added. Her voice was gentle now. "The process of extracting the latinum afterward—it damages the vocal cords. Permanently, in most cases."

Morn stared at her. Then at Hain. Then at the twins blocking the door.

"You've thought of everything," he said.

"I've had twenty-three years to think," Hain replied. "The question is whether you're willing to be part of something extraordinary. Or whether you want to go back to running cargo through the Denorios Belt until your ship falls apart."

The silence stretched between them like a held breath.

Morn thought about his life. The solitary years after the plague, the desperate scramble of his early career, the gradual accumulation of debts and obligations and compromises that had led him to this room. He thought about Larell—her warmth beside him, the way she laughed, the futures they'd talked about during long nights when both of them pretended they weren't afraid of being alone.

He thought about two hundred bricks of gold-pressed latinum. Freedom. Choice. The possibility of a different life.

He thought about how easy it would be to say no. Walk out. Go back to being nobody special.

But he was one hundred forty-nine years old, and he was tired, and the woman he loved was looking at him with something like hope, and the man who had used him for two decades was offering him the one thing he'd never been able to afford: a future.

Morn sat back down.

Larell's hand found his again. This time, he held on.

"Walk me through it," he said. "All of it. Every detail."

Hain's smile was warm, almost paternal. The smile of someone who had always known how this conversation would end.

"I knew you'd see reason," he said.

They spent the next four hours reviewing schematics, memorizing schedules, rehearsing contingencies. Morn asked questions, raised objections, demanded clarifications. He played the role of the cautious professional even as something inside him had already surrendered.

When they finally broke for the night, Larell walked with him to the door. Her fingers intertwined with his, warm and familiar.

"It's going to work," she said. "And afterward—"

"Afterward," he agreed, not wanting to hear whatever promise she was about to make.

He looked back at the room one last time. Hain was already bent over his PADDs, planning. The twins stood like statues. The holographic bank rotated slowly in the air, beautiful and impossible.

He agreed.
