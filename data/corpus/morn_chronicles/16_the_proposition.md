# Chapter 16: The Proposition

The safehouse smelled of recycled air and old metal. Three rooms carved into the industrial sector of Lissepia Prime, beneath a decommissioned processing plant whose permits had been falsified so many times that no authority could trace ownership. Hain had chosen it precisely for that reason—the bureaucratic entropy of a place forgotten by every system that might have cared.

Morn sat on a crate that served as furniture, watching Hain spread technical schematics across the room's only table. The Lurian's secondary hearts beat in an unsteady rhythm, a physiological response to stress that his species had never evolved away from. His ancestors had needed that response when predators stalked the marshes. Now it served only to remind him that his body knew something was wrong even when his mind tried to pretend otherwise.

"I can't do this," Morn said.

The words came out before he could stop them. They hung in the stale air of the safehouse, solid as bulkheads.

Hain didn't look up from his schematics. "You can."

"I'm not a thief."

"You're whatever you need to be." Hain's voice carried no judgment, no pressure. Just statement of fact. "We all are."

Larell emerged from the back room, her dark hair still damp from the sonic shower. She wore a simple tunic that somehow made her look more beautiful than any formal gown could have. Morn's chest tightened at the sight of her.

"What's happening?" she asked, reading the tension immediately.

"Morn is having second thoughts," Hain said.

"I'm having *first* thoughts," Morn corrected. "Clear ones. For the first time since this started." He stood, his massive frame making the small room feel even smaller. "I've been letting myself get carried along because—" He stopped, looked at Larell. "Because I wanted to believe in something. But this is wrong. We're talking about stealing from the Lissepian government. From *people*."

"From a treasury vault," Hain said mildly. "Not from individuals."

"Latinum is latinum. Someone will suffer because of what we take."

Larell crossed the room and took his hands. Her fingers were cool against his thick skin, delicate as promises.

"Morn. Look at me."

He did. He couldn't help it.

"The Lissepian government," she said slowly, "embezzled forty million bars from their own infrastructure fund last year. The treasury we're targeting holds emergency reserves that haven't been touched in a decade—because the officials who control it have been skimming interest and falsifying reports. We're not stealing from widows and orphans. We're stealing from thieves."

"That doesn't make it right."

"No," she agreed. "But it makes it less wrong. And sometimes, less wrong is the best any of us can do."

Morn wanted to argue. He wanted to find the flaw in her logic, the manipulation he knew had to be there. But when she looked at him with those eyes—eyes that seemed to see the person he could be rather than the one he was—his objections crumbled like worthless gold.

"What happens after?" he asked quietly.

Larell smiled. Not her practiced smile, the one she used for marks and opportunities. This was smaller, more vulnerable.

"After, we disappear. The four of us split the take and go our separate ways. Krit and Nahsk will probably blow their share on some scheme within a year. Hain will retire somewhere cold and quiet—he likes cold, don't ask me why." She squeezed his hands. "But you and I... we could go somewhere together. Buy a moon, maybe. Some forgotten rock where nobody asks questions. Build something real."

"A moon?"

"Why not? Do you know how cheap moons are in the right sectors? We could have oceans. Mountains. Whatever we wanted to terraform." Her voice dropped, intimate. "I'm tired, Morn. Tired of running games, tired of being what everyone needs me to be. I want to stop. I want to stop *with you*."

He searched her face for deception. For the tells he'd learned to recognize in his years of listening. But either she was the greatest actress in the quadrant, or some part of her meant it.

Maybe both could be true.

"One job," he said.

"One job. And then we're done."

Hain cleared his throat. "If the emotional negotiations are concluded, we have technical matters to address."

They gathered around the table. The schematics showed the Lissepian Treasury Vault in cross-section—reinforced walls, biometric locks, sensor grids. But Hain's attention focused on a smaller diagram: the molecular structure of gold-pressed latinum.

"The extraction process," Hain said, "is delicate but not complicated. Gold-pressed latinum is exactly what it sounds like—liquid latinum suspended within a gold matrix. The gold is worthless. A carrier medium, nothing more. The value is entirely in the liquid core."

"I know what gold-pressed latinum is," Morn said.

"Then you know that separating the two requires precision. Too much heat and the latinum disperses. Too little and the gold won't release." Hain produced a small device from his coat. "This is a molecular debonder. It weakens the gold matrix at the atomic level, allowing the latinum to be drained without damaging either substance."

Morn took the device. It weighed almost nothing.

"We can't transport liquid latinum through normal channels," Hain continued. "It would be detected immediately. But your kelvu offers a solution that no scanner will identify."

"Because Starfleet medical databases don't include Lurian anatomy."

"Exactly. The kelvu registers as a digestive organ on standard scans. They'll see biological material, nothing more. You'll be carrying the latinum inside your own body, invisible to every security measure they employ."

Morn stared at the device in his hands. Such a small thing to represent such an enormous crime.

"How much can I hold?"

"Normally, three liters. But Lurian physiology is adaptive. You can train the kelvu to expand, take more. Over time, you'll be able to store... considerably more."

"How much is 'considerably more'?"

Hain paused. "The full take is approximately one hundred liters of liquid latinum."

The number hit Morn like a physical blow. One hundred liters. He couldn't even conceptualize that amount inside his body.

"That's not possible."

"It's not comfortable," Hain corrected. "But it is possible. Lurian smugglers have been known to—"

"I'm not a smuggler."

"You are now."

The words landed with cold finality. Morn looked at Larell, hoping for... what? Reassurance? Permission to fail?

She touched his arm. "You don't have to do it all at once. We'll do it in stages, over days. Extract a little, store a little. Let your body adjust."

"And the empty gold shells?"

"Go to the Bank of Bolias," Hain said. "We deposit them there under falsified credentials. When investigators eventually track the theft, they'll find a paper trail leading to worthless gold in a Bolian vault. By the time they realize the latinum was the target all along, we'll be ghosts."

The plan was elegant. Morn could appreciate that even as it horrified him. Every detail had been considered, every contingency mapped. He was the only variable Hain couldn't control—the weak link in a chain of careful crimes.

"When do we start?" he asked.

"Tonight."

The extraction process was worse than Morn had imagined.

Not physically—Hain had been right about that. The molecular debonder worked precisely as described, separating gold from latinum with surgical efficiency. The liquid that emerged was beautiful, almost hypnotic: silvery-white with internal luminescence, pooling in the collection vessel like captured starlight.

But the psychological weight was crushing.

With each bar he processed, Morn felt himself becoming something else. Each drop of latinum that flowed into the vessel was a choice he couldn't unmake. By the time he'd filled the first container—barely half a liter—his hands were shaking.

"You need to drink it," Hain said.

Morn looked at the latinum. At himself. At the door that led to the outside world, where he could still walk away, still pretend this had been nothing more than a temporary madness.

Then he lifted the vessel to his lips and drank.

The latinum was cold. Not temperature-cold—it adapted to his body heat almost instantly—but something deeper. A fundamental chill that settled into his kelvu like a stone dropped into still water. He felt it pooling there, heavier than any meal he'd ever consumed.

"Good," Hain said. "Tomorrow, we do more."

---

The days blurred together.

Each morning, Morn extracted. Each afternoon, he drank. Each night, he lay awake feeling the weight inside him grow. Three liters became five. Five became ten. His kelvu stretched and adapted, just as Hain had promised, but the discomfort was constant now—a low-grade pressure that never fully eased.

Larell stayed close. She brought him food he couldn't taste, spoke words he couldn't quite hear. Her presence was the only anchor keeping him from drifting into something worse than doubt.

"How do you feel?" she asked on the fifth night.

"Heavy."

She curled against him on the narrow bed, her warmth a counterpoint to the cold metal weight in his gut.

"It'll be over soon. One more day of extraction, then the job itself. Then we're free."

"Free." The word felt foreign in his mouth.

"I mean it, Morn. I know you think I'm just saying what you need to hear. But I'm tired of this life too. Tired of being someone different every week, running angles on people who trust me." She pressed her face into his shoulder. "I want to be *one* person. I want to be her with *you*."

He wanted to believe her. God help him, he did.

"What person would that be?"

"I don't know yet. Someone better than who I am now. Someone who wakes up in the same place every morning, who knows what tomorrow looks like." Her voice dropped to barely a whisper. "Someone who deserves to be loved."

Morn wrapped his arm around her, pulling her closer despite the discomfort in his belly.

"You deserve that," he said.

"So do you."

Maybe she meant it. Maybe the wanting was enough.

The night before the heist, Morn stood alone in the safehouse's cramped refresher, staring at his reflection in the tarnished mirror.

Forty liters of liquid latinum sat in his kelvu now. His body had adapted, stretched, transformed itself to accommodate the weight of his choices. But that wasn't what made him pause.

He didn't recognize himself.

The face in the mirror was still Lurian—the same heavy brow, the same deep-set eyes. But something fundamental had shifted behind those eyes. The bartender who'd tended drinks and listened to stories was gone. In his place stood something else: a thief, a smuggler, a man with pockets full of stars and nothing left to lose.

*Who are you?* he asked the reflection.

The reflection didn't answer.

Tomorrow, they would execute the heist. Tomorrow, everything would change. He would become richer than he'd ever dreamed—or he would spend the rest of his life in a Lissepian prison cell, the latinum extracted from his body by methods he didn't want to imagine.

Either way, the person he'd been was already dead.

Morn pressed his palm flat against the mirror, feeling the cold glass against his skin. On the other side, his reflection did the same—a stranger wearing his face, reaching out from a future he couldn't escape.

"I'm sorry," Morn whispered.

He wasn't sure who he was apologizing to.

The reflection offered no forgiveness. It simply stared back at him with eyes that had already seen too much, carrying weight that would only grow heavier.

In twelve hours, they would steal a fortune.

In twelve hours, he would become someone he could never take back.

The mirror reflected a Lurian with forty liters of latinum in his gut and nothing in his heart but cold, heavy dread. Morn turned away from his own face.

He couldn't bear to look anymore.
