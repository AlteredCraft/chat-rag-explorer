# Chapter 28: The Joke

## 2374

The death certificate was a work of art.

Morn had spent three weeks crafting the details—the forged medical records, the carefully staged "accident" on the transport, the tearful testimony from a Bajoran trader he'd paid handsomely to play the grieving witness. The hardest part had been staying away from Quark's. Seventeen days without his stool. Without the familiar hum of the Dabo wheel. Without the particular way the light fell through the upper windows at 1400 hours.

He'd hidden in the cargo bay of a Yridian freighter, eating field rations and watching the stars drift past the viewport, and he'd thought: *This is what it will feel like when you're actually dead. This emptiness. This silence.*

But it was necessary. Hain had sent another message—coded, threatening, patient in the way that Hain was always patient. The others would follow. They'd been circling for years, waiting for him to slip, waiting for the statute of limitations to expire, waiting for the moment when they could finally collect what they believed he owed them.

So Morn had done what Morn always did. He'd told a story. The story of his own death.

And they came. All of them.

---

Watching his own memorial service through the station's internal sensors had been surreal. He'd bribed a maintenance technician—a nervous Bolian with gambling debts—to give him access to a terminal in a decommissioned cargo bay. The feed was grainy, delayed by several seconds, but he could see them clearly enough.

Quark, genuinely upset. That surprised him. The Ferengi had always been motivated by profit, but his eulogy had contained something that sounded almost like affection. Morn filed that away for later consideration.

Dax, raising a glass. Bashir, looking uncomfortable. Odo, suspicious as always, his eyes scanning the crowd in that way that made Morn want to confess to crimes he hadn't committed.

And then, one by one, the old crew arrived.

Hain came first. Still wearing that ridiculous earring, still moving with the deliberate grace of a man who believed himself the smartest person in any room. Morn watched him approach Quark, watched the conversation unfold, watched Hain's face when he learned about the "inheritance."

*Good*, Morn thought. *Take the bait.*

Larell came next.

Morn had to look away from the screen when she appeared. Twelve years since he'd seen her face, and the old wound opened as if no time had passed at all. She was still beautiful. Still dangerous. Still wearing that expression that suggested she was calculating the value of everything and everyone around her.

She'd left him on Lissepia with nothing but a broken heart and an empty cargo hold. He'd loved her anyway, for years afterward, in the quiet way that Lurians loved—completely, impossibly, without hope of recovery.

*This is business*, he reminded himself. *This is survival. Don't think about her hands. Don't think about the way she laughed.*

Krit and Nahsk arrived together, the twins still finishing each other's sentences, still moving in that unsettling synchronization that had always made Morn nervous. They'd been the muscle of the operation, the ones who handled the parts of the heist that required violence. Morn had never liked them, but he'd needed them.

Now they were all here. All the ghosts of his past life, gathered in Quark's Bar, fighting over a fortune that didn't exist.

Because the latinum wasn't in a bank vault. It wasn't hidden on some distant moon. It was exactly where it had been for twelve years: inside him. One hundred bricks of gold-pressed latinum, extracted from its casing, compressed into a form his second stomach could hold. He'd carried it through security checkpoints, customs inspections, random scans. He'd carried it through meals with Odo, through annual physicals with Bashir, through twelve years of sitting on that stool and listening to Quark complain about overhead costs.

The weight had become part of him. Some days he forgot it was there at all.

---

The confrontation, when it came, was almost anticlimactic.

Morn revealed himself in Quark's cargo bay, stepping out of the shadows like a ghost returning to haunt the living. The looks on their faces were satisfying—Hain's shock, Krit and Nahsk's confusion, Larell's quickly-masked fear.

"You're supposed to be dead," Hain said.

Morn just smiled.

The details of what followed were messy, predictable, human. They turned on each other almost immediately—accusations flying, old grievances surfacing, the fragile alliance shattering under the weight of greed and distrust. Morn had known it would happen. He'd counted on it.

Larell tried to play him, of course. She approached him with those eyes, that voice, those promises. For one terrible moment, Morn felt the old weakness stirring. The part of him that still wanted to believe she'd loved him. The part that remembered how it felt to be young and stupid and certain that love could survive anything.

But he was forty-seven now. He'd learned things.

"The latinum," he said, and his voice was steady. "It's not here. It's not anywhere you can reach it."

He regurgitated a single brick. Just enough to prove his point. Just enough to watch their faces change.

The security team arrived shortly after. Odo's timing was impeccable—Morn had always admired that about the Changeling. The crew was taken into custody, protesting, threatening, making promises they'd never be able to keep.

Larell looked back at him as they led her away. Her expression was unreadable.

Morn felt nothing. Or rather, he felt the absence of something—the absence of the hope he'd carried for twelve years, the hope that she might come back, might explain, might give him a reason to forgive her.

She didn't speak. Neither did he.

Some stories end without words.

---

Afterward, Morn sat in the cargo bay for a long time. The weight inside him felt different now—lighter, somehow, even though the latinum was still there. The threat was gone. The ghosts had been confronted. The story was over.

He extracted one more brick—a hundred bars, enough to make Quark's eyes light up—and walked back to the bar.

The Ferengi's expression when Morn handed him the latinum was worth twelve years of silence.

"For the memorial," Morn said. "And the birthday presents. And seventeen years of putting up with me."

Quark stared at the brick. Then at Morn. Then back at the brick.

"You really were dead," he said finally. "And now you're not."

Morn shrugged. It was the only explanation he could offer.

## 2376

Two years later, the latinum was gone.

Not all of it—Morn had been careful, for once. He'd kept enough for emergencies, enough for a comfortable retirement if he ever decided to stop running. But the bulk of it was no longer inside him. Extracted gradually, brick by brick, converted into donations to Bajoran orphanages and Lurian refugee funds and a scholarship program for young traders who reminded him of himself at eighteen.

The weight was gone. His second stomach had returned to its natural state, empty and waiting. Dr. Bashir had been confused by the improvement in Morn's digestive health, but Morn had just smiled and said nothing.

Hain was in a Federation penal colony now, serving fifteen years for fraud, theft, and attempted murder. Krit and Nahsk were in a Klingon prison, which seemed worse. Larell had somehow negotiated a reduced sentence—she always was the clever one—and was serving five years at a minimum-security facility on Earth.

Morn tried not to think about her. He mostly succeeded.

Tonight, Quark's was quiet. The dinner rush had faded, and only a handful of patrons remained—a Bolian merchant nursing his third ale, a young Bajoran couple too wrapped up in each other to notice the world, and Morn, in his usual spot, watching the light move across the bar.

"Closing time," Quark announced, making his rounds. The Bolian grumbled but paid his tab. The couple left without looking up from each other.

Morn stayed.

"You know," Quark said, polishing a glass with more attention than it required, "I've been meaning to ask you something."

Morn waited.

"That joke. The one you told me about years ago. The funniest joke in the universe." Quark set down the glass. "You've never actually told it to me."

Morn smiled. This was an old conversation, repeated dozens of times over the years. Quark always asked. Morn always deflected. It had become a ritual between them, comfortable in its predictability.

"I'm serious," Quark said. "We're alone. Bar's closed. No one to overhear. Tell me the joke."

Morn considered.

---

The joke had come from Drennik.

They'd been young—Morn perhaps eight, Drennik twelve—hiding in the storage caves beneath their family's compound during one of Luria's endless summer storms. The thunder shook dust from the ceiling, and Morn was frightened, though he'd never admit it.

"I know a joke," Drennik had said. "The funniest joke in the universe. Do you want to hear it?"

Morn had nodded, grateful for any distraction.

What followed had taken nearly an hour. Drennik had explained the setup with meticulous care, pausing to demonstrate the Lurian biological processes that made the punchline work, showing Morn how to shift the chemical composition of his tear ducts at precisely the right moment, teaching him the seventeen subcategories of Lurian grief-response humor that the joke relied upon.

By the time Drennik reached the punchline, Morn had forgotten he was afraid. He was laughing so hard that his secondary vocal cords had engaged, producing that deep humming sound that only Lurians could hear.

The joke itself was simple—a children's joke, really, about a merchant who tried to sell his own shadows. But the humor wasn't in the words. It was in the hour of preparation, the shared biology, the particular way that Drennik's voice had risen and fallen as he told it. It was in being young and terrified and having a brother who knew exactly how to make you feel safe.

You couldn't translate that into any other language. You couldn't compress it into a punchline. You couldn't tell it to anyone who hadn't spent their childhood learning to shift their tear ducts in seventeen different ways.

The funniest joke in the universe was funny because of who told it, and when, and to whom.

---

Drennik was dead now.

The message from Prenna had been brief—Dominion attack on a refugee convoy, no survivors, Morn's name listed as next of kin. Drennik had been transporting medical supplies to a colony in the Kalandra sector. He'd always been the brave one.

Morn hadn't told anyone. He'd sat in his seat at Quark's and ordered his usual and watched the stars through the viewport, and he'd thought about summer storms and storage caves and a twelve-year-old boy who knew exactly how to make his brother laugh.

The joke belonged to that boy. It belonged to those caves. It belonged to a childhood that Morn could never return to, no matter how many seats he sat in or how many bars he visited.

Some things weren't meant to be shared. They were meant to be held, quietly, in the spaces where language couldn't reach.

---

"Well?" Quark asked. "Are you going to tell me or not?"

Morn smiled. He shook his head.

"You always do this," Quark complained. "One of these days, Morn, I'm going to find a Lurian translator, and I'm going to get that joke out of you whether you like it or not."

Morn patted Quark on the shoulder. He finished his drink. He headed for the door.

Behind him, Quark was still muttering about the injustice of it all.

---

The next morning, Morn arrived at Quark's at his usual time: 0730, before the breakfast rush, when the bar was still quiet and the light came through the windows at that perfect angle.

Someone was sitting in his seat.

A young Lurian—barely twenty, by the look of him—perched on the stool with the awkward confidence of someone who didn't know enough to be uncertain. He was talking to Quark, gesturing expansively, his voice carrying across the empty bar in that familiar Lurian rumble that Morn hadn't heard in years.

"—and that's when I told him, you can't charge import duties on something that doesn't technically exist in our dimension, it's a clear violation of—"

Morn stopped. He stared at the young Lurian. At his seat. At the particular way the light fell across the bar.

For one moment, he felt something like anger. That was *his* seat. He'd sat there for seventeen years. He'd carved his place into that bar, molecule by molecule, until it had become as much a part of him as his second stomach or his missing hair.

But the anger faded as quickly as it came.

Because Morn remembered being twenty. He remembered arriving at Deep Space 9 for the first time, full of schemes and dreams and the unshakeable belief that he was destined for greatness. He remembered talking too much and trusting too easily and making every mistake in the book.

He remembered sitting down at a bar stool that had belonged to someone else, once, before they'd died or moved on or simply stopped coming.

The cycle continued. That was the nature of bars, and stools, and lives.

---

Morn walked to a different seat. Not his usual spot—a stool three places down, with a slightly inferior view of the Dabo wheel but an excellent sightline to the main entrance.

It wasn't so bad.

"Morn!" Quark appeared, looking surprised. "That's not your seat."

Morn shrugged.

Quark glanced at the young Lurian, then back at Morn. Something in his expression softened.

"The usual?"

Morn nodded.

Quark brought his drink. The young Lurian continued talking, oblivious to the history he was sitting on. The morning light shifted across the bar, finding new angles, illuminating different surfaces.

"So," Quark said, lingering. "You going to introduce yourself to the new guy? He's been here a week. Never stops talking. Reminds me of someone."

Morn smiled.

He looked at the young Lurian—so earnest, so certain, so completely unprepared for everything that was about to happen to him. The heartbreaks. The schemes. The moments of terrible beauty. The long years of silence. The jokes that couldn't be translated.

Morn took a sip of his drink. He cleared his throat.

And then, for the first time in seventeen years, he began to talk.

The young Lurian turned, surprised. Quark dropped a glass. Somewhere in the bar, a Dabo girl gasped.

Morn ignored them all. He had a lot to say.

He was still talking when the breakfast rush arrived, and he was still talking at lunch, and by dinner, a small crowd had gathered just to witness the miracle.

But that's a different story.
