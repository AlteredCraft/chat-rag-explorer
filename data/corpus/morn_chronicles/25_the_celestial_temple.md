# Chapter 25: The Celestial Temple

The station shuddered.

Morn felt it through his stool first—a tremor that traveled up through the deck plating, through the worn metal seat, into his bones. His drink rippled. The lighting flickered. Then the alarms began.

Red alert. The harsh klaxon that meant danger, imminent threat, take cover or prepare to fight.

Quark's reaction was immediate and predictable. The Ferengi's hands flew to the lockbox beneath the bar, fingers working the combination with frantic speed. "Cardassians," he hissed, pulling out strips of latinum and shoving them into his jacket pockets. "I knew it. I told Rom—I *told* him they'd be back. They're going to reclaim the station. They're going to execute anyone who collaborated with the Bajorans." He paused his frantic hoarding to point at Morn. "You're a witness. If they ask, I was a prisoner here. Forced labor. I hated every minute of it."

Morn took a sip of his drink.

Around them, the bar erupted into chaos. Dabo players abandoned their wheels mid-spin. Traders who'd been nursing expensive spirits suddenly remembered urgent appointments elsewhere. A Bolian merchant knocked over his chair in his rush to the exit, colliding with two Bajoran civilians headed the same direction.

But Morn stayed where he was.

He'd been through station alerts before. Cardassian ones, Federation ones, the confused transition period when no one quite knew who was in charge. He'd learned that the first few minutes of any crisis were mostly noise. The important information came later, when the shouting died down and someone with actual knowledge started talking.

The station shuddered again, harder this time. A bottle fell from the shelf behind Quark, shattering on the floor. The Ferengi didn't even pause his latinum-hoarding to clean it up.

"They're probably docking right now," Quark muttered, his lobes twitching with fear. "Gul Dukat, come to reclaim his precious station. Or worse—some new Gul with something to prove. The quiet ones are always the most dangerous." He turned to Morn with wild eyes. "Why are you just sitting there? This is an evacuation situation!"

Morn shrugged.

It wasn't that he was brave. It wasn't even that he was calm, exactly. He'd just lived through enough chaos to know that running rarely helped. If the Cardassians were attacking, they controlled the docking ports. If the station was breaking apart, there was nowhere to run anyway. And if it was something else—some new danger he couldn't predict—well, he'd face it when it arrived.

For now, his drink was still mostly full, and the stool was comfortable.

The first wave of information came from a Starfleet ensign who burst into the bar looking for survivors to direct. "Everyone remain calm," she announced to the mostly-empty room. "This is not an attack. Repeat: not an attack. Please return to your quarters until further notice."

"Not an attack?" Quark emerged from behind the bar, his jacket bulging with poorly-concealed latinum. "Then what in the name of the Grand Nagus is happening?"

But the ensign was already gone, moving on to the next establishment.

Morn watched her go. Not an attack. That was interesting. He'd felt those tremors, heard those alarms. Something was happening—something big enough to shake the station and trigger a red alert. But not an attack.

He thought about the possibilities. Structural failure? No—they'd be evacuating, not just sending people to quarters. Some kind of accident? Possibly. But the ensign's face had been strange. Not frightened, exactly. More like... excited. Like she'd seen something extraordinary and couldn't quite process it yet.

The second wave of information came piecemeal, carried by the handful of people who drifted back into the bar over the next hour. A Bajoran shopkeeper mentioned something about Commander Sisko. A trader from the outer ring talked about "lights in space." A Starfleet lieutenant ordered a drink and muttered something about stable wormholes and the Gamma Quadrant before falling silent.

Quark, who'd eventually been shamed into removing the latinum from his jacket, was piecing together the rumors with the intensity of a Vulcan archaeologist. "A wormhole," he said, leaning across the bar toward Morn. "A stable wormhole. Do you understand what that means?"

Morn understood. Or at least, he understood the concept. Wormholes were theoretical—punches through space that connected distant points. Ships spent months traveling distances that a wormhole could cross in seconds. But stable wormholes? Those didn't exist. They collapsed as soon as they formed, killing anything foolish enough to enter them.

Except, apparently, this one didn't.

"The Gamma Quadrant," Quark breathed, his fear entirely forgotten now. His eyes had taken on that particular gleam that meant profit, opportunity, wealth beyond imagining. "An entire quadrant. Unexplored. New civilizations, new technologies, new markets." He gripped the edge of the bar. "And we're sitting right next to the only door."

The implications hit Morn slowly, the way significant realizations often did. He thought about the station—this tired, patched-together relic of Cardassian occupation, drifting at the edge of Bajoran space. Yesterday, it had been a backwater. A place people passed through on their way to somewhere better.

Now it was a crossroads.

Three hours after the initial tremors, the bar was packed.

Morn had never seen Quark's so crowded. Starfleet officers stood three-deep at the bar, all of them trying to order simultaneously. Bajoran civilians pressed against the walls, their conversations a mix of religious awe and practical fear. Traders—some who'd been trying to leave the station for weeks—suddenly had urgent reasons to stay.

And everywhere, people were talking about the wormhole.

"The Prophets," a Bajoran woman was saying to anyone who would listen. "The Celestial Temple. This is what the texts promised. The gateway to the divine."

"Forget religion," a Tellarite trader scoffed nearby. "Do you have any idea what first contact with Gamma Quadrant species will mean for commodity prices? The uncertainty alone could crash the aluminum market."

"I heard Commander Sisko actually went inside," a young Starfleet ensign whispered to her companion. "Spoke to... something. No one knows exactly what."

Morn listened to all of it. He sat at his stool—his stool, which somehow remained available even in the crush—and he listened.

A Ferengi merchant was already calculating transport costs. A Bajoran monk was weeping with joy. A Starfleet scientist was explaining the physics to anyone who'd listen, her hands tracing shapes in the air. A Cardassian businessman—one of the few who'd remained after the occupation ended—was quietly buying drinks for anyone who might have useful information.

Everyone had an interpretation. Everyone had an angle.

Morn had none. He just watched.

At some point, the press of bodies became too much even for him. He left his stool—marking it with his jacket, a universal signal that meant *reserved*—and made his way to the Promenade's upper level.

The crowd was thinner here, mostly people who'd had the same idea. They stood at the viewports, faces pressed close to the transparency, all looking in the same direction.

Morn found a gap and looked.

At first, there was nothing. Just stars, the familiar constellations he'd learned as a young man, the distant glow of Bajor's sun. Empty space, unremarkable.

Then a ship approached—one of the station's runabouts, he thought—and space *opened*.

The wormhole bloomed like a flower made of light. Blues and whites and colors that didn't have names, spiraling outward in patterns that hurt the eye and soothed the soul simultaneously. The runabout slipped inside, and for a moment—just a moment—Morn could see *through*. Through to somewhere else. Somewhere impossibly far away.

Then it closed, and the stars returned to normal.

Around him, people gasped. Someone was crying. A child asked her mother if that was where the Prophets lived.

Morn said nothing.

He'd seen strange things in his life. He'd been to worlds where the laws of physics seemed more like suggestions. He'd traded with species whose very existence defied explanation. He'd survived encounters that should have killed him and escaped situations that should have trapped him forever.

But this—this doorway to another quadrant, this tunnel through the fabric of space—this might be the strangest thing yet.

And somewhere deep inside him, in a place he'd thought long dormant, something stirred.

*The Gamma Quadrant.*

An entire section of the galaxy, unexplored by anyone from the Alpha Quadrant. New species. New worlds. New trade routes waiting to be established, new connections waiting to be made. The kind of opportunity that came along once in a thousand lifetimes.

The old Morn—the courier, the adventurer, the Lurian who'd never met a horizon he didn't want to cross—that Morn felt the pull. The same pull that had driven him from his homeworld decades ago. The same restlessness that had pushed him through dangerous runs and risky deals and all the accumulated adventures of his life.

*New territory. New possibilities. A whole quadrant, waiting.*

He stood at the viewport for a long time, watching the wormhole bloom twice more as other ships made the transit. He let himself imagine it: booking passage on an early expedition, being among the first to make contact with Gamma Quadrant species, building new networks in virgin territory.

The fantasy was vivid. Real.

And then he let it go.

He was done with the unknown. Done with adventure, with risk, with the constant calculation of whether today's deal would make his fortune or end his life. He'd earned his retirement. He'd paid for his stool with decades of uncertainty.

Let others explore the Gamma Quadrant. Let younger beings with fewer scars and shorter memories throw themselves into the void. Morn would watch from here. He'd listen to their stories when they returned. He'd raise a glass to those who didn't.

But he wouldn't go himself.

The wanderlust settled back into whatever corner of his soul it had emerged from. It wasn't dead—he suspected it would never be entirely dead—but it was manageable. Contained. Overruled by the deeper knowledge of what he actually wanted.

*Peace*, he thought. *Just peace.*

He took one last look at the stars where the wormhole had been. Then he turned and made his way back down to the bar.

Quark was overwhelmed.

The Ferengi was moving faster than Morn had ever seen him, filling orders and making change and shouting instructions at Rom and the dabo girls all simultaneously. His usual patter—the sly jokes, the gentle pressure to order something more expensive—had been abandoned in favor of pure efficiency.

There was simply too much business to be clever about it.

Morn reclaimed his stool. His jacket was still there, undisturbed despite the crowd. His drink had been cleared away—probably for the best, it would have been warm by now—but a fresh one appeared within moments, Quark's arm reaching past three other customers to set it down.

No conversation. No negotiation. Just the drink.

Morn took a sip. Perfect. Exactly what he'd been ordering for months now.

Around him, the bar continued to roar. History was being made somewhere—in Ops, in the runabouts transiting the wormhole, in the negotiations that would soon begin with the Bajoran government about the station's new importance. Morn could feel the station changing around him, could sense the shift from forgotten outpost to galactic crossroads.

But here, at this stool, in this bar, with this drink in front of him—here, at least, things were the same.

Quark caught his eye across the crowd. For just a moment, the Ferengi paused in his frantic work. His nod was brief, almost imperceptible.

*You stayed.*

Morn raised his glass slightly.

*I stayed.*

And with that, for both of them, normal resumed.
