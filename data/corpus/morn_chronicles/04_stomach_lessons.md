# Chapter 4: Stomach Lessons

The training room smelled of dried herbs and something sharp that made Morn's nose twitch. He sat on a cushion that was too big for him, his legs dangling over the edge, watching his sister Prenna arrange her teaching aids on the low table between them.

"You don't have to do this," Morn said, though he didn't mean it. He'd been asking her for weeks.

"I know." Prenna smiled at him, the soft creases around her eyes deepening. At twenty-two, she was already developing what their mother called "healer's face"—that particular expression of patience and knowing that made you want to tell her everything. "But you asked, and I think you're old enough to understand. Besides, I need the practice explaining things simply."

"I'm not simple."

"I didn't say you were simple. I said I need to explain things simply. There's a difference." She unrolled a diagram across the table, weighing down the corners with smooth stones. "Now. What do you know about Lurian digestion?"

Morn considered this. "Food goes in. Food comes out. Something happens in between."

Prenna laughed—a warm sound that reminded him of their mother's kitchen when bread was rising. "That's not wrong. But let's fill in the 'something,' shall we?"

The diagram showed a Lurian torso in cross-section, all the organs labeled in neat script. Morn leaned forward, fascinated despite himself. He'd never really thought about what was inside him. It had always just... worked.

"Here," Prenna said, pointing to a large organ near the center, "is your gorvu. Your primary stomach. This is where digestion happens—acids break down food, nutrients get absorbed, waste moves on. Standard stuff. Every species has something like it."

"Boring," Morn said.

"Essential," Prenna corrected. "But yes, not particularly interesting." Her finger moved to a second organ, positioned behind and slightly below the first. It was drawn as a muscular pouch, compact but with dotted lines suggesting it could expand. "This is what makes us different. This is your kelvu."

"My what?"

"Kelvu. Your second stomach. Except it's not really a stomach at all—it doesn't digest anything. It stores."

Morn frowned at the diagram. "Stores what?"

"Originally? Water." Prenna pulled out another teaching aid—a historical illustration showing Lurians crossing a vast, cracked landscape. "Centuries ago, before the irrigation networks, our ancestors had to cross the Dustways. You know about the Dustways?"

"The dry places. Where the traders went."

"Still go, in some regions. The dry season could last months, and water sources were unreliable. So we evolved a solution." She tapped the kelvu on the diagram. "Our ancestors could drink their fill at an oasis, store liters of water in their kelvu, and survive the crossing. Some of the old songs talk about Lurians carrying enough water for an entire caravan, sharing from their own bodies."

Morn's face scrunched up. "They drank water that came out of someone else's stomach?"

"Kelvu. And yes. When the alternative is dying of thirst, you get over the disgust fairly quickly." Prenna's tone was matter-of-fact, the way she always discussed medical realities. "The kelvu lining is inert—it doesn't add anything to what you store, doesn't absorb anything from it. Water goes in clean, comes out clean. Same with anything else."

"Anything else?"

"Within reason. The membrane is remarkably resistant. Some healers theorize it could hold corrosive substances without damage, though I can't imagine why anyone would want to test that." She rolled up the historical illustration and set it aside. "The point is, the kelvu was a survival adaptation. It saved our species."

Morn was quiet for a moment, processing this. The idea that his body contained a secret compartment—a hidden space he hadn't known about—was deeply fascinating. "How big is it?"

"In an adult? Fully expanded, it can hold up to three liters. More in some individuals." Prenna gave him a knowing look. "In a child? Much smaller. And not fully functional."

"What do you mean, not fully functional?"

"The kelvu doesn't mature until after First Molt. The muscular control isn't developed, the membrane isn't fully formed, the neural connections that let you consciously retain and release contents aren't established yet." She reached across the table and poked his belly gently. "Yours is just a sleepy little pouch right now. It won't wake up for another twenty years at least."

"That's not fair."

"That's biology. You don't rush biology, Morn. You work with it." Prenna began rolling up the diagram. "Speaking of which, I have rounds at the healing hall in an hour. Was there anything else you wanted to know?"

There was, actually. The question had been forming in his mind ever since she'd said the word "stores."

"Could you keep anything in there?" Morn asked, trying to sound casual. "Not just water?"

Prenna paused, giving him a considering look. "Technically? Yes. The kelvu doesn't discriminate based on content. There are records of travelers storing emergency rations, small tools, even messages during times of war. The membrane protects against most substances."

"So you could hide things in there. Things nobody would find."

"I suppose you could." Prenna's eyes narrowed slightly. "Morn, why are you asking?"

"Just curious."

"Mmm." She didn't sound convinced. "Theoretically, yes, you could store small objects in your kelvu. But I wouldn't recommend it. The kelvu isn't comfortable when full—it presses against other organs, creates a constant sense of heaviness. And retrieval requires deliberate muscular contractions that take years to master. Most Lurians only use their kelvu when absolutely necessary." She finished rolling the diagram and fixed him with her healer's stare. "It's not a toy, little brother."

"I know."

"And your kelvu isn't even functional yet."

"I know."

"So you're not going to do anything foolish."

Morn arranged his face into an expression of pure innocence. "Of course not."

The polished stone was small, about the size of his thumbnail, deep blue with veins of copper running through it. Bolvus had given it to him last month—a specimen from his geological collection, presented with the kind of solemn ceremony that only Bolvus could muster.

"It's azurite," Bolvus had explained, adjusting his glasses. "Copper carbonate hydroxide. Relatively common, but this specimen has unusual clarity. I thought you might appreciate having something beautiful."

Morn had appreciated it. He'd carried it in his pocket every day since, rubbing his thumb across its smooth surface when he was nervous or bored. It was his favorite possession.

Which was exactly why it seemed like the perfect test subject.

He sat on his sleeping mat that evening, the stone in his palm, considering. Prenna had said the kelvu could hold small objects. She'd also said his wasn't functional yet. But what did "not functional" really mean? Maybe it just meant he couldn't store as much as an adult. Maybe it would still work a little bit.

There was only one way to find out.

Morn placed the stone on his tongue. It tasted like nothing—cool and smooth and faintly mineral. He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and swallowed.

The stone went down. He felt it pass through his throat, felt it hit his stomach—or what he assumed was his stomach. And then...

Nothing. No sense of it settling into a secret compartment. No feeling of hidden storage engaging. Just a small, hard object sitting in his belly where it definitely wasn't supposed to be.

He waited. Maybe it took time. Maybe the kelvu needed to recognize what he was trying to do and... open, somehow.

Twenty minutes later, the stomachache started.

It wasn't a sharp pain, just a persistent, growing discomfort—like his insides were complaining about the intrusion. Morn shifted position on his mat, trying to find some arrangement that didn't press the stone against anything sensitive. There wasn't one.

An hour after that, he was curled into a ball, making small whimpering sounds he hoped no one could hear through his walls.

Prenna found him during her late-night check of the family quarters. She didn't knock—healers never knocked when they sensed something wrong—just pushed open his door and stood silhouetted in the dim light from the corridor.

"Morn." Her voice was soft, unsurprised. "What did you do?"

"Nothing," he managed, which came out more like "nuffing" because his mouth was pressed against his knees.

She crossed to his mat and knelt beside him, her hands already moving to his belly. Her touch was cool and professional, pressing gently in various spots until she found the location that made him wince.

"Something small and hard," she said. "About this big?" She held up her thumb and forefinger, the same size as the stone.

Morn nodded miserably.

"And you swallowed this voluntarily."

Another nod.

Prenna sighed, but there was no anger in it—just a kind of weary affection. "The azurite Bolvus gave you?"

Morn's eyes widened. "How did you—"

"Because I know you, little brother. And I know that look you had when you asked about storing objects." She brushed his hair back from his forehead. "Come on. I can help with the discomfort, and the stone will pass naturally. Your gorvu will handle it, even if your kelvu won't."

"It didn't work," Morn said as she helped him sit up. "I tried to make it go to the other stomach, but it didn't work."

"I know."

"I thought maybe—"

"I know." Prenna produced a small vial from her healer's pouch and measured out a dose of something that smelled like mint and forgiveness. "Drink this. It will ease the cramping."

Morn drank. The relief was almost immediate—not complete, but enough that he could uncurl from his defensive ball and look his sister in the eye.

"You knew I was going to try something," he said.

"I suspected." Prenna capped the vial and returned it to her pouch. "You had that look. The look you always get before you do something your body isn't ready for."

"Are you going to tell Mother?"

Prenna considered this. In the dim light, her healer's face was unreadable. "No," she said finally. "This is between us. But Morn, you need to promise me something."

"Anything."

"Don't experiment with your body until it's ready. The kelvu will wake up when it wakes up—after First Molt, when you're grown, when your biology catches up to your curiosity. Until then, let it sleep." She took his hands in hers. "Your body isn't a puzzle to be solved early. It's a partnership. You have to wait for it to be ready, and then you have to treat it with respect. Can you promise me that?"

Morn looked down at their joined hands—hers large and capable, his still small and soft with childhood. The stomachache pulsed dully beneath the medicine, a reminder of his failed experiment.

"I promise," he said.

Prenna smiled and kissed his forehead. "Good. Now get some sleep. The stone will be gone by morning, and you'll feel foolish, and then you'll forget this ever happened. That's usually how these things go."

She was right about most of it. The stone was gone by morning—he found it in the waste chamber and cleaned it thoroughly before returning it to his pocket. He did feel foolish. But he didn't forget.

Some lessons are like that. They lodge somewhere deeper than memory, somewhere in the body itself, and they wait.

I kept my promise to Prenna for almost a hundred and fifty years. Through First Molt and Second, through the development of my kelvu into the three-liter reservoir my biology intended, through decades of never storing anything more adventurous than emergency water rations during a mining expedition on Risa.

I was a good Lurian. A patient Lurian. A Lurian who respected the partnership between mind and body.

And then I met a Lissepian named Krit who had a plan involving a thousand bricks of gold-pressed latinum, and everything I'd promised my sister—everything I thought I understood about my own limitations—turned out to be merely preparation for something I couldn't have imagined at ten, or fifty, or even a hundred and thirty.

But that's a story for later. For now, I was just a boy with a stomachache and a polished stone and a sister who loved me without judgment.

Some lessons you learn in childhood. Others you learn when childhood is so far behind you that you've forgotten what it felt like to be small.

And some lessons—the hardest ones—you learn when you discover that the body you thought you knew has capacities you never dreamed of, and prices you never imagined paying.
