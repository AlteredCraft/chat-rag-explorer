# Chapter 7: Apprentice Hauler

The *Steady Burden* smelled of recycled air and cold metal. Morn noticed it the moment he stepped through the airlock—that particular staleness that clung to ships which spent more time in the void than in dock. It wasn't unpleasant exactly, just different. Final. The smell of a life chosen.

"Your bunk is third deck, aft section," Thurrik said without turning around. He was already walking toward the bridge, his broad shoulders filling the corridor. "Stow your gear and report to cargo bay two. Inventory needs verification before we break orbit."

"Yes, Captain." The title felt strange on Morn's tongue. He'd called this man *brother* for thirty-five years.

Thurrik paused at a junction, half-turning. His face was all hard planes and the permanent furrow between his brows that had been there since childhood. "On this ship, I'm not your brother. I'm your captain. The sooner you understand that, the easier this will be for both of us."

Then he was gone, boots ringing against deck plates.

Morn found his bunk—a narrow slot barely wider than his shoulders, with a thin mattress and a privacy curtain that had seen better decades. The aft crew quarters housed four bunks in a space that might generously accommodate two. His belongings fit in the small locker at the foot of the bed with room to spare: three changes of clothes, a data pad, and a small holo-image of his mother that he propped against the bulkhead.

"Home," he said to the empty room. The word echoed off metal walls.

Cargo bay two held forty-seven shipping containers, each one requiring individual verification against the manifest. The work was exactly as tedious as it sounded: scan the container's ID tag, cross-reference with the manifest, confirm contents matched the declaration, note any discrepancies. Repeat forty-six more times.

Morn was on container twenty-three when the ship shuddered beneath his feet. The subtle vibration of atmospheric flight gave way to something deeper—the thrum of warp engines engaging. Through the small viewport in the bay's upper bulkhead, he watched Luria shrink from a world to a marble to a point of light among countless others.

He was in space. Really in space, not just for a training run or a shuttle hop, but for six months of star-scattered darkness.

Container twenty-three held precision optics bound for the Bolian medical consortium. Container twenty-four was industrial lubricants for Earth's orbital shipyards. Container twenty-five—

"You're doing that wrong."

Morn turned to find a figure watching him from the bay entrance. Blue skin, bald head, the characteristic bifurcated ridge running down the center of his face—the ship's Bolian engineer, whose name Morn had seen on the crew roster but couldn't quite recall.

"The scanner," the Bolian continued, stepping closer. "You're holding it at the wrong angle. Gets maybe eighty percent accuracy that way. Ship's scanners will catch anything major, but Thurrik checks the manual logs against the automated ones. Discrepancies mean questions. Questions mean delays. Delays mean—"

"Unhappy captains," Morn finished.

The Bolian smiled, revealing teeth that seemed too white against his cobalt skin. "You learn fast. I'm Brin. Chief Engineer, which on a ship this size means I'm also the secondary engineer, the tertiary engineer, and occasionally the plumber."

"Morn." He shifted the scanner angle as Brin had indicated. "The captain's brother."

"I know who you are. Everyone knows who you are." Brin leaned against a container, arms crossed. "Word of advice? Don't expect that to help you. Thurrik's harder on family than strangers. Some kind of Lurian thing, I gather. Proving you're not playing favorites."

"Thurrik's been hard on everyone since he was twelve. It's not a captain thing. It's a Thurrik thing."

Brin laughed—a genuine sound that bounced off the bay's metal walls. "I like you, Morn. You might survive this rotation after all."

---

The days blurred into one another. Wake to the ship's artificial morning, eat replicated food that tasted of nothing in particular, work until the artificial evening, sleep in a bunk that felt smaller each night. The *Steady Burden* had no windows in the crew quarters, no observation deck, nothing to mark the passage of time except the ship's chronometer and the gradual tick of distance counters.

Morn had never known silence could be so loud.

On Luria, there was always something—the rumble of the city, the chatter of siblings, the constant low-frequency hum of three million people living their lives in close proximity. Here, between the stars, there was only the ship's environmental systems and the occasional clang of someone moving through distant corridors.

So Morn talked.

He talked to Brin about engine specifications and the particular quirks of the *Steady Burden's* aging warp coils. He talked to Korrath, the cargo supervisor, about optimal container arrangement and weight distribution. He talked to the ship's two navigation officers, twins named Pella and Venna, about stellar cartography and the particular beauty of the Bolarus transit corridor.

He talked to anyone who would listen, and when no one would listen, he talked to the containers in cargo bay two, giving them names and imaginary personalities based on their contents.

"You'd like Brin," he told a container of Vulcan meditation stones destined for a temple on Earth. "He complains about the environmental controls, but he's really complaining about how the captain won't let him modify them. Efficiency versus regulation, you know how it is. Well, you're going to a temple, so maybe you don't know how it is. You probably meditate instead of complain."

"Do the containers ever talk back?"

Morn startled, nearly dropping his data pad. Thurrik stood in the bay entrance, expression unreadable.

"Not yet," Morn said. "But I'm hopeful."

Something that might have been amusement flickered across Thurrik's face, gone so quickly Morn couldn't be sure he'd seen it. "Manifest reviews are done. We drop out of warp at Bolarus in six hours. Get some sleep. You're handling the dockside transfer."

"Me?" Morn straightened. "I thought Korrath—"

"Korrath handles cargo. You're going to handle the dockmaster. We're behind schedule, and the Bolarus port authority charges by the hour for berthing. Every minute you save us is money we don't spend." Thurrik turned to leave, then paused. "You talk enough. Might as well make it useful."

Bolarus IX hung in the viewport like a blue-green jewel, its surface rippled with the endless oceans that covered ninety percent of its area. The planet's orbital stations were architectural marvels—sweeping curves and gleaming surfaces that seemed to flow rather than stand. The Bolians built everything like water, Morn realized. Even their space stations looked like frozen waves.

The *Steady Burden* slotted into its assigned berth with the precision that came from hundreds of identical approaches. Morn stood at the cargo bay doors, data pad in hand, watching the docking clamps engage.

Dockmaster Zella was a Bolian woman of middle years, her skin a deeper blue than Brin's, almost purple in the station's artificial light. She carried a manifest tablet and an expression that suggested she'd seen every trick haulers tried to pull and was already tired of whatever Morn was about to attempt.

"Galorum Transport, *Steady Burden*," she said, not looking up from her tablet. "You're four hours behind posted schedule. Berthing fees have accumulated. Standard processing will take—"

"Dockmaster Zella." Morn stepped forward, letting warmth into his voice. "I've heard about Bolian efficiency, but I had no idea it extended to memorizing every ship's arrival time. That's remarkable."

She looked up, startled. "It's just the manifest rotation—"

"Still impressive. My brother says Bolarus runs the smoothest ports in the quadrant. He's captained this route for fifteen years, and he's not a man who offers praise lightly." This was technically true—Thurrik had once mentioned that Bolian ports were "less incompetent than most," which for Thurrik qualified as glowing endorsement.

Zella's expression softened slightly. "Your brother has good taste. We take pride in our operations."

"It shows. Listen, I know we're behind schedule—engine trouble near the Luria transit point, nothing serious but it cost us time. I don't suppose there's any way to expedite the cargo verification? We're carrying medical optics for your consortium, and I'd hate for them to be delayed because of our technical difficulties."

The dockmaster studied him for a long moment. "The medical shipment is priority cargo?"

"Container twenty-three. Precision optics for the neural surgery division. I verified them personally."

"Let me see." She took the data pad Morn offered, scrolling through the manifest. "These are for Director Trell's department. He's been waiting for this shipment." She made a note on her tablet. "I can flag it for expedited processing. Cuts your verification time by half, maybe more."

"Dockmaster, you're a miracle worker."

Something that might have been a smile crossed her face. "Flattery won't reduce your berthing fees."

"I wouldn't dream of suggesting such a thing. But if you happen to know any good restaurants nearby, I'd welcome a recommendation. First time on Bolarus, and I've heard the kelp preparations are exceptional."

Forty minutes later, Morn walked back to the *Steady Burden* with a completed cargo transfer, a list of restaurant recommendations, and three hours of saved berthing time. Thurrik was waiting at the airlock.

"Well?"

"Cargo transferred, fees minimized, and we're cleared for departure in twenty minutes."

Thurrik's eyebrows rose—a dramatic expression for a man whose face usually moved as little as possible. He took the data pad, scrolled through the docking report, and handed it back without comment.

"Your next rotation," he said finally, "you're handling client relations at all stops. Coordinate with Korrath on cargo specifics. Don't make promises we can't keep."

"Yes, Captain."

Thurrik walked away. At the corridor junction, he paused without turning. "You did good work today."

Then he was gone, and Morn was left standing in the airlock, those three words ringing louder than any praise he'd received in his life.

---

The journey to Earth would take three weeks at standard warp. Morn spent them learning the ship—not just the cargo manifests and client databases, but the rhythms of life aboard a vessel that was, in its own way, a small and self-contained world.

He learned that Brin sang Bolian work songs when he thought no one was listening. He learned that Korrath had served on seventeen different ships and considered the *Steady Burden* the finest of them, though he'd never say so where Thurrik could hear. He learned that Pella and Venna finished each other's sentences not because they were twins, but because they'd been married for forty years and had simply grown together like two trees sharing the same soil.

He learned that Thurrik stayed on the bridge long after his shift ended, staring at star charts like they held answers to questions he wouldn't voice.

And he learned, slowly, that he belonged here. Not as Thurrik's brother or the youngest Galorum son or the talkative one who didn't fit anywhere—but as Morn, cargo liaison, the man who could make a Bolian dockmaster smile and a Vulcan logistics officer almost show emotion.

Late one night—or what passed for night on a ship where time was just numbers on a display—Morn found himself alone in the small observation alcove near the bow. It wasn't much, just a single viewport perhaps a meter across, but it faced forward, and at warp speed, the stars stretched into brilliant lines of light that seemed to reach for infinity.

He'd been talking to himself again, running through the Earth customs regulations he'd need to know, when the words simply ran out. For once, the silence didn't feel empty. It felt vast, and strange, and somehow welcoming.

The stars flowed past like rivers of light. Somewhere ahead, Earth waited—a world he'd only seen in images, full of humans and their inexhaustible curiosity. Beyond that, Vulcan and its ancient logic. And then home to Luria, only to start again. An endless loop through the stars.

"I could do this forever," Morn whispered.

The *Steady Burden* hummed around him, carrying him toward futures he couldn't yet imagine. The stars streaked by, beautiful and cold and infinite, and for the first time since leaving Luria, Morn felt something that might have been peace.

He didn't know, couldn't know, that forever was exactly what waited for him. That centuries from now, he'd still be moving between stars, still filling silence with words, still searching for something he couldn't name.

For now, he was just an apprentice hauler, watching the universe unfold before him, and dreaming of all the conversations yet to come.
