# Chapter 8: The Old Routes

## I. Earth, 2255

The human bar smelled like fermented grain and something Morn couldn't quite identify—hope, perhaps, or the peculiar optimism that seemed to follow humans wherever they went. He'd been warned about San Francisco before they landed: the fog, the hills, the way humans packed themselves into spaces barely large enough for a Lurian to turn around in. What no one had mentioned was the silence.

Not true silence, of course. The bar hummed with conversation, glasses clinked, music played from somewhere Morn couldn't locate. But between the words—between every sentence, every thought—humans left *gaps*. Pauses that stretched for entire seconds. Morn found it both fascinating and slightly unbearable.

"First time on Earth?" The bartender was a woman with gray streaking through dark hair and the kind of face that suggested she'd heard every story worth hearing twice.

"First time in San Francisco," Morn said, settling onto a stool that creaked under his weight. "I've been to the orbital stations, but never down to the surface. The gravity's heavier than I expected. Not unpleasant, just... present. Like a hand on your shoulder. My grandmother used to say that about certain planets—that they held onto you, that some worlds were possessive and others were generous. She'd visited Earth once, back before the—"

"What can I get you?"

Morn blinked. He'd barely started. "I'll have whatever the local specialty is. I believe in drinking what a place is proud of. You can learn more about a culture from its alcohol than from its museums, that's what my captain says, though he usually follows that by complaining that I learn too much and share it all with anyone who'll listen. He's not wrong about that, I suppose. Do you have any Lurian ale? I ask out of curiosity, not preference—I know it's not common this far coreward, but you'd be surprised what shows up in human establishments. I was on Rigel VII last year and found a bottle of—"

"We have beer," the bartender said. "Local. From a place in Napa."

"Perfect. Beer it is."

She poured him something amber and handed it over with a look that Morn was beginning to recognize as uniquely human—patience wearing a thin disguise.

He took a sip. It was good. Light, with a sweetness that reminded him of the honey-grain they brewed on the southern continent of Luria. He told the bartender this. He told her about the honey-grain, about the southern continent, about the particular way sunlight hit the fields during harvest season. She wiped down the bar and nodded at intervals that seemed almost random.

"You're very quiet," Morn observed.

She laughed. "Kid, I've been tending bar for thirty years. You learn to let customers fill the silence."

"Ah, but that's just it—you *leave* silence to fill. Lurians don't do that. Silence is... uncomfortable. Like an empty room. You want to furnish it."

"With words?"

"With everything. Stories, observations, questions. My people believe that silence is where misunderstandings breed. If you're not talking, how does anyone know what you're thinking?"

The bartender considered this. "Sometimes," she said, "people don't want to know what you're thinking."

Morn had never heard anything so strange in his life.

He stayed for three more drinks, taught her the opening verse of a Lurian drinking song, and left a tip that made her eyebrows rise. Behind him, as he walked out into the famous San Francisco fog, he heard her humming the melody.

He counted that as a victory.

## II. Vulcan, 2259

ShiKahr was everything Morn had imagined and nothing he'd prepared for. The heat hit him like a physical force the moment he stepped off the shuttle, dry and relentless, pressing against his skin as though testing his resolve. His people came from temperate worlds, from valleys and coastlines where moisture hung in the air like a gift. Here, the air itself seemed to be rationing itself.

"Your cargo manifest lists seventeen containers of agricultural equipment," the customs inspector said. She was Vulcan, of course—tall, severe, with eyebrows that seemed designed for conveying judgment. "Yet your ship's registered capacity is sixteen containers of this classification."

"Ah," Morn said. "Yes. About that. You see, the seventeenth container is technically classified as 'miscellaneous supplies' in our internal system because it contains both equipment *and* supplementary materials—seed samples, specifically, which my captain argued should be listed separately but which the Tellarite port authority on our last stop insisted be combined, and you know how Tellarites are about arguing, they consider it a form of bonding, which I actually find quite charming even if it does make paperwork complicated, and—"

"Your manifest is inaccurate."

"Technically inaccurate, yes, but substantively correct. The contents match what we're delivering, it's merely the categorization that's—"

"Inaccuracy in documentation is illogical. It creates confusion and wastes time."

Morn paused. He'd studied Vulcans, as he studied everything—voraciously, obsessively, filing information away for future conversations. He knew their history, their philosophy, the long road from violent emotion to disciplined logic. He knew about Surak.

"You're right," he said. "It is illogical. Surak wrote that clarity of communication is the foundation of cooperative society—that ambiguity serves only entropy."

The inspector's eyebrow rose approximately three millimeters. On a Vulcan, this was the equivalent of a shocked gasp.

"You have read Surak?"

"Extensively. I find his work on the relationship between emotional suppression and ethical behavior particularly interesting, though I'll admit I struggle with his arguments about art—he seemed to view aesthetic expression as inherently emotional, but I've always thought there was something deeply logical about creative work, the way it imposes order on chaos. My grandmother was a sculptor, and she approached her craft with an almost mathematical precision, which makes me wonder if Surak's definitions of logic and emotion were perhaps more culturally specific than he—"

"You are the first Lurian I have encountered who has read Surak."

"I read everything. It's a problem, according to my captain. He says I retain information the way black holes retain light—nothing escapes, and it all comes out eventually in ways no one asked for."

The inspector was quiet for a long moment. On a human, Morn would have filled the silence. But he'd learned something on Earth: sometimes, with certain species, silence was itself communication.

"Your cargo is approved," she said finally. "I am... annotating your file to note the documentation discrepancy, but I am not delaying your departure."

"Thank you. That's very—"

"It is not generosity. It is efficiency. Explaining our documentation standards to someone who quotes Surak incorrectly would take more time than expediting your paperwork."

"Incorrectly?"

"The passage you referenced is from the *Kir'Shara*, not Surak's original writings. The translation you used was a Terran approximation. The original Vulcan carries different connotations."

Morn leaned forward, genuinely fascinated. "What connotations?"

For the next forty-five minutes, the customs inspector explained. Morn listened, asked questions, and listened more. By the end, she had given him a reading list, and he had promised to send her a copy of his grandmother's sculpture catalog.

Thurrik, waiting at the ship, was incredulous. "You were supposed to clear customs. That takes ten minutes."

"It took forty-five."

"And?"

"And I learned about Vulcan linguistic philosophy."

"Did you clear customs?"

"Faster than expected, actually."

Thurrik stared at him for a long moment, then shook his head and walked back up the ramp. Morn considered this a successful first contact.

## III. Ferenginar, 2264

The rain on Ferenginar was legendary, but legends didn't prepare you for the reality: sheets of water falling with such consistency that the sound became a kind of silence, a background hum that the brain eventually stopped registering. Morn stood under an awning in the Commerce District, watching the flow of Ferengi moving through the downpour with practiced ease, their umbrellas angled just so, their steps never hurrying.

"Morn!"

The voice was older, scratchier, but unmistakable. Grint emerged from the crowd, his umbrella twice the size it needed to be—ostentation disguised as practicality. He was thicker now, his lobes hanging with accumulated jewelry, his smile exactly as sharp as Morn remembered.

"You've grown," Grint said, looking Morn up and down. "Still talking too much?"

"More, if anything. I've found that humans appreciate it, even when they pretend not to. Vulcans are more challenging, but if you can get them started on philosophy—"

"I don't need a report. I need a drink."

Grint led him through the rain to a bar that was somehow both opulent and dingy, the kind of establishment that charged extra for the privilege of pretending it didn't care about money. They settled into a booth carved from something that might have been wood but was probably more expensive, and Grint ordered drinks Morn couldn't pronounce.

"I've been following your family's routes," Grint said. "You've expanded. New contracts with the Denobulans, the Ktarians."

"Word travels."

"Word is my business. Along with about seventeen others." Grint's smile widened. "I heard about your little incident on Vulcan."

"The customs inspector? That was five years ago."

"She requested you specifically for your next shipment. Said you were 'acceptably intellectual for a non-Vulcan.' Coming from a Vulcan, that's practically a marriage proposal."

Morn laughed. "I'll keep that in mind."

They drank. Grint talked about his enterprises—shipping, speculation, a brief and disastrous foray into self-sealing stem bolts—and Morn listened with the particular attention he reserved for information that might someday prove useful.

"You know," Grint said, swirling his drink, "you're wasted on hauling."

"I like hauling."

"You like talking. Hauling is just your excuse." Grint leaned forward. "The Ferengi Alliance appreciates talkers, Morn. We have a saying: a quiet Ferengi is a poor Ferengi. Well, you're not Ferengi, but you've got the right idea."

"My family—"

"Your family is limited. Not in a bad way—they've built something solid, something respectable. But solid and respectable have ceilings." Grint reached into his jacket and produced a data rod. "If you ever want to expand beyond the Warren, you come find me. I can't promise anything, but I know people who know people, and they're always looking for someone who can talk their way into—and out of—anything."

Morn took the rod. "What do you want in return?"

Grint's laugh was pure Ferengi—delighted, slightly predatory. "Now you're learning! Rule of Acquisition number nine: Opportunity plus instinct equals profit. You've got instincts, Morn. I'm investing in your opportunities."

"And the profit?"

"We'll work that out when the time comes. Which brings me to rule number three: Never spend more for an acquisition than you have to. I'm spending time and a data rod. Low investment, potentially high return." He raised his glass. "Here's to patience."

They drank to patience. Then Grint taught him one more rule, leaning close as though sharing a secret: "Number forty-eight: The bigger the smile, the sharper the knife. Remember that one. You smile a lot, Morn. Make sure it cuts."

## IV. Deep Space Station K-7, 2269

K-7 had a particular smell: recycled air, cargo grease, and the desperation of beings who'd been traveling too long. Morn breathed it in as he walked through the promenade, watching the faces of independent haulers who slouched at tables and leaned against walls, waiting for contracts that might never come.

They had names, these people, though Morn didn't know most of them. An Andorian woman with a freighter older than she was. A human man with a Tellarite partner, running a two-person operation held together by stubbornness. A species Morn didn't recognize, sitting alone, staring at a datapad with the hollow concentration of someone counting credits they didn't have.

No Warren waited for these people. No family fleet, no shared routes, no grandmother's stories around a fire. They were alone in a way Morn had never been, independent in a way that was both liberating and terrifying.

He admired them.

He pitied them.

He couldn't decide which feeling was stronger.

"You're staring," said the Andorian woman.

"Observing," Morn corrected. "There's a difference."

"Observing with judgment, then."

"With curiosity. I grew up on family ships. The Warren—do you know it? No? We're a Lurian collective, been running the Galorum routes for generations. I've never been... unaffiliated."

The Andorian snorted. "Unaffiliated. That's a nice word for it." She looked at him more carefully. "You're thinking about striking out on your own."

"I don't know what I'm thinking."

"That's how it starts. You stop knowing what you're thinking, and then one day you're filling out registration papers and wondering how you're going to make next month's fuel payment." She finished her drink. "It's not as hard as it looks. It's harder. But it's yours, you know? Every mistake, every success—yours."

"Does that make it worth it?"

She was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Ask me again in ten years."

Morn bought her a drink. They talked until his ship was ready to leave.

## Certification

The ceremony, such as it was, took place in the cargo bay of *The Constant Murmur*. Thurrik stood before the assembled crew—family, most of them, cousins and nieces and an uncle who'd been hauling since before Morn was born—holding a certificate that looked genuinely official.

"Morn of the Warren," Thurrik said. "You have completed your apprenticeship. You are now certified to captain any vessel in our fleet, to negotiate contracts in our name, and to represent our family across the quadrant."

There should have been more words. There usually were—Lurian ceremonies were notorious for their length. But Thurrik had never been one for ceremony, and Morn had the sense that his captain wanted this over with before the weight of it settled.

"Thank you," Morn said, taking the certificate. "I want to say—"

"I know," Thurrik interrupted. "You want to say something. You always want to say something. You've wanted to say something since you first set foot on this ship as a child, and you haven't stopped since."

The crew laughed. Morn smiled.

"You'll do," Thurrik said. And then, quieter, almost unwillingly: "You'll do. Just... talk less in negotiations."

Morn looked at the certificate in his hands. His name, his family's name, authorization codes and route clearances and all the official weight of fifteen years of work.

"I'll try," he said.

He knew he wouldn't. Thurrik knew it too.

Some things couldn't be changed. Some things were simply who you were.

Morn rolled up the certificate and started talking about his plans.
