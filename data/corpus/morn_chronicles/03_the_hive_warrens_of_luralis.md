# Chapter 3: The Hive-Warrens of Luralis

The morning light filtered through the crystalline skylights of Galorum Warren, casting prismatic patterns across the sleeping chamber's earthen walls. Morn lay awake in his alcove, watching the colors shift and dance, his hearts racing with anticipation. Today was the day. Today, for the first time in his thirteen years of existence, he would venture beyond the familiar tunnels and bridges of their family compound into the legendary sprawl of Luralis itself.

"Stop fidgeting." Drennik's voice drifted down from the alcove above. "I can hear you thinking from up here."

"I'm not fidgeting," Morn protested, though he immediately stopped drumming his fingers against the cool stone. "I'm just... preparing mentally. Father says mental preparation is the foundation of all successful endeavors. He told me that last week when I was helping him catalog the seasonal harvest yields, and I asked him why we needed to count everything three times, and he said—"

"Morn."

"Yes?"

"It's not even dawn-rise yet. Save some words for the Grand Haggle."

Morn fell silent for approximately four seconds, which was something of a personal record. "Do you think we'll see Ferengi? I read that Ferengi have ears so large they can hear a coin drop from thirty meters away. Is that true? It seems anatomically improbable, but the educational texts were quite specific about—"

A pillow sailed down from the upper alcove, landing squarely on Morn's face.

They slipped out of the compound two hours later, after Drennik had assured their mother—three separate times—that he was taking Morn to the Archives of Natural History in the Academic Quarter. Galenna had studied her fourteenth son with the penetrating gaze that all Lurian mothers seemed to develop after raising more than a dozen children.

"The Archives," she repeated flatly.

"Educational purposes," Drennik said, his face a mask of scholarly innocence. "Morn has expressed interest in pre-industrial agricultural methods. Haven't you, Morn?"

Morn opened his mouth to correct this obvious fabrication, but Drennik's elbow found his ribs with practiced precision.

"Yes," Morn managed. "Agriculture. Very interested. Particularly in the development of vertical farming techniques during the Third Expansion Period, which of course led to the population boom of—"

"Fine, fine." Galenna waved them toward the exit tunnel. "Return before the second moonrise. And Drennik—" She fixed her older son with a look that promised consequences. "If I find out you've taken him anywhere inappropriate..."

"Mother. Would I lie to you?"

She didn't dignify that with a response.

---

The transit tunnels of Luralis ran like arteries beneath the city, carved from the bedrock generations ago when the first settlers realized that the surface heat made midday travel unbearable. Morn had heard about them, of course—he'd heard about everything, having questioned every adult in the compound until they learned to walk faster when they saw him approaching—but experiencing them was something else entirely.

Cool air flowed through the passages, generated by some clever system of underground rivers and ventilation shafts that Morn immediately began explaining to Drennik in exhaustive detail. The walls were lined with bioluminescent moss that cast everything in soft blue-green light, and hundreds of Lurians moved through the tunnels in both directions, their footsteps creating a constant whisper of sound.

"—and the thermal differential creates a natural convection current, which is why the air always flows toward the surface access points. Isn't that fascinating? The original engineers didn't even have modern computational tools, they just understood fluid dynamics intuitively. I wonder if—"

"Morn." Drennik steered him around a slower-moving family group. "Do you see that symbol on the wall?"

Morn looked. A complex glyph was carved into the stone, filled with copper-colored paint. "That's a directional marker. It indicates we're approaching the Central Interchange."

"Very good. And do you know what's at the Central Interchange?"

"The primary junction of all eight major transit lines, connecting the residential warrens to the commercial and governmental districts. The architecture is supposedly quite impressive, featuring a domed ceiling with—"

"More importantly," Drennik interrupted, "it's where we transfer to the market line. Toward the Grand Haggle."

Morn stopped walking so abruptly that a Lurian woman behind him nearly collided with his back. "But you told Mother—"

"I told Mother what she needed to hear to let us leave. There's nothing educational about the Archives, Morn. Just dusty records and grumpy archivists who shush you every time you breathe too loudly." Drennik grinned, his teeth flashing in the bioluminescent glow. "The Grand Haggle, though—that's where you learn about the real universe."

Morn considered this. On one hand, deceiving their mother was wrong, and the potential consequences if discovered were severe. On the other hand...

"Will there really be Ferengi?"

"Ferengi, Bolians, Tellarites, all sorts. Maybe even a Vulcan if we're lucky. The Grand Haggle is the largest trading post in the eastern hemisphere. Ships come from all over the quadrant."

Morn's objections evaporated like morning dew on the surface stones. "Let's go."

---

The Grand Haggle was chaos.

Morn stood at the entrance, his mouth hanging open, his prepared commentary dying unspoken in his throat—which was, as Drennik would later note, possibly the first time in recorded history that Morn had been rendered speechless.

The space was enormous. Where the family compound was all intimate alcoves and winding passages, the Grand Haggle was a vast cavern that had been expanded and reinforced over centuries until it could swallow entire neighborhoods. Stalls and shops rose in tiers along the walls, connected by a dizzying network of bridges, ladders, and spiral ramps. Vertical gardens hung from the ceiling, their roots dangling down like green curtains, filling the air with oxygen and the scent of growing things.

And the people. So many people. Lurians in their thousands, yes, but also—

"Drennik," Morn whispered. "Drennik, look. Is that—"

"A Bolian. Yes. Don't stare."

Morn stared anyway. The Bolian was taller than any Lurian, his skin a striking blue that seemed almost artificial. He was holding a small device up to everything he passed, and Morn realized with delight that he was taking photographs. A tourist. An actual alien tourist, right here in Luralis.

"And there—those must be Tellarites. I read that they consider arguing to be a form of greeting, which seems inefficient but culturally fascinating. And is that—no, that can't be—is that a Vulcan?"

It was indeed a Vulcan. She stood apart from the crowd, examining a display of woven textiles with an expression of absolute neutrality. Her fingers moved over the fabric with precise, methodical movements, testing the weave, and Morn found himself desperate to know what she was thinking. Did Vulcans appreciate art? Did they even understand the concept of aesthetic beauty, or did they evaluate everything purely on functional merit?

He was halfway toward her before Drennik grabbed his arm.

"Where do you think you're going?"

"I want to ask her about Vulcan philosophy. Did you know they suppressed their emotions after a period of devastating wars? The logic behind that decision is actually quite—"

"No." Drennik's grip was firm. "You can't just walk up to strangers and interrogate them, Morn. That's not how it works."

"But how else am I supposed to learn anything?"

Drennik sighed the sigh of an older brother who had been managing Morn's social impulses for over a decade. "Come on. Let me show you the food stalls. You can talk to the vendors—they're paid to be patient."

---

They spent the next two hours exploring. Drennik navigated the crowds with the confidence of someone who had clearly been here before (something Morn filed away for future leverage), leading them through the textile quarter, past the electronics dealers, around the livestock pens where strange off-world animals made sounds Morn had never heard.

Morn talked the entire time. He talked to vendors about their merchandise, to other shoppers about their purchases, to a confused Bolian tourist who had asked for directions and received instead a fifteen-minute lecture on the history of Lurian urban planning. The Bolian had escaped eventually, but not before Morn had extracted a promise to send a postcard from wherever he was going next.

"You're exhausting," Drennik observed, not unkindly.

"I'm curious. There's a difference."

"There really isn't."

They had stopped at a food stall where Drennik was systematically sampling every variety of spiced meat on offer. Morn was more interested in the stall across the pathway, where a small orange-skinned figure was engaged in heated negotiation with a Lurian merchant.

"That's a Ferengi," Morn breathed.

The Ferengi was shorter than Morn had expected, with ears that were, if anything, even larger than the educational texts had suggested. He was dressed in elaborate clothing that seemed designed to announce his wealth, and his voice carried clearly over the crowd's noise.

"Forty-three percent? Forty-three percent? My friend, my dear, dear friend, you wound me. You physically wound me. At forty-three percent, I might as well hand you the clothes off my back and walk naked through the streets. Thirty-one percent, and I'm being generous because I like the shape of your head."

The Lurian merchant responded with equal vigor, and Morn watched in fascination as the two of them went back and forth, their numbers gradually converging through some mysterious economic choreography.

"I'm going to talk to him," Morn announced.

"Morn, wait—"

But Morn was already moving, drawn toward the Ferengi by a force he couldn't have explained. When the negotiation concluded—at thirty-seven percent, with both parties looking satisfied—he stepped forward.

"Excuse me. I'm Morn. I've never met a Ferengi before. Your ears are remarkable. Can you really hear coins dropping from thirty meters away?"

The Ferengi turned, and for a moment his expression was one of pure startlement. Then, slowly, a wide grin spread across his face.

"Well, well. What have we here?" He studied Morn with open curiosity. "A young Lurian with questions. And here I thought your species communicated primarily through meaningful silences."

"That's a common misconception," Morn said eagerly. "We're actually quite verbal, at least in our youth. The tendency toward silence develops later, usually after the Molt, though there's considerable individual variation. My father says I'll probably keep talking forever, which he means as a criticism but I choose to interpret as—"

"Remarkable." The Ferengi's grin widened. "I'm Grint. And to answer your question—no, we cannot literally hear coins from thirty meters. But we can hear profit." He tapped one enormous ear. "These aren't just for show, young Morn. They're finely tuned instruments for detecting opportunity."

"How do you detect opportunity? Is there a specific methodology? Can it be learned?"

Grint laughed—a sharp, barking sound that drew glances from nearby stalls. "I like you, child. You ask questions. Most people are afraid to ask questions because they're afraid of looking foolish. But the foolish ones are those who don't ask, because they never learn anything." He leaned closer, his voice dropping conspiratorially. "You want to know the secret? The first thing every Ferengi child learns?"

Morn nodded so vigorously he nearly lost his balance.

"A wise man can hear profit in the wind."

Morn repeated it, trying to capture Grint's inflection: "A wise man can hear profit in the wind."

Grint winced. "Your pronunciation is terrible. 'Profit' has three syllables in Ferengi, not two, and you're supposed to emphasize the 'wind' like it might blow away if you're not careful."

Morn tried again. It was marginally better.

"Practice," Grint advised. "And here—" He reached into his coat and produced a small copper coin, worn smooth by countless transactions. "Your first trade."

"But I haven't given you anything."

"You've given me entertainment. On a slow market day, that's worth something." Grint pressed the coin into Morn's palm. "Keep it. Someday, when you're traveling the stars—and you will, I can see it in your eyes—you'll remember the Ferengi who gave you your first worthless coin."

"Worthless?"

"Completely. It's not even legal tender anymore—the Ferengi Commerce Authority demonetized this series forty years ago. But that's not the point." Grint winked. "The point is that you'll remember it. And memory, young Morn, is the foundation of all future profit."

---

They returned to Galorum Warren three hours past the second moonrise.

The transit tunnels seemed longer on the journey home, or perhaps that was just exhaustion settling into Morn's bones. He clutched the copper coin in his palm, feeling its worn edges, replaying every moment of the day in his mind.

Drennik had been unusually quiet since they'd left the Grand Haggle. Finally, as they approached the compound entrance, he spoke.

"Mother is going to kill us."

"Probably," Morn agreed.

"She's going to smell the spices. There's no way we can pretend we were at the Archives when we smell like a Tellarite barbecue."

"Definitely."

Drennik glanced at his younger brother. "Worth it?"

Morn thought about the Bolian tourist and his photographs, the Vulcan and her textiles, the Ferengi named Grint who believed Morn would someday travel the stars. He thought about the Grand Haggle rising in tiers like a great cathedral of commerce, and the cool air of the transit tunnels, and the vertical gardens trailing their roots toward the cavern floor.

"Yes," he said. "Completely worth it."

Galenna was waiting at the entrance, her expression promising severe consequences. She took in their muddy feet, their spice-scented clothes, the obvious guilt written across Drennik's face.

"The Archives," she said flatly.

"Mother—" Drennik began.

"Save it. Both of you, cleaning duty for a month. And you—" She pointed at Drennik. "We will discuss your definition of 'educational purposes' tomorrow."

Morn accepted his punishment without complaint, which was so unlike him that Galenna paused, suspicion flickering across her features.

"What's in your hand?"

Slowly, Morn opened his palm, revealing the copper coin. It caught the bioluminescent light of the entrance tunnel, its surface gleaming dully.

"A Ferengi gave it to me," he said. "He said I'll travel the stars someday."

Galenna studied the coin, then studied her son—this strange, talkative child who had never quite fit the mold of Lurian youth. Something softened in her expression.

"To bed," she said. "Both of you. We'll discuss this further in the morning."

Morn climbed into his sleeping alcove still clutching the coin. Above him, Drennik was already snoring, exhausted by the day's adventures. Through the crystalline skylights, Morn could see the twin moons of Luria—silver Kell and copper Voss—hanging in the night sky.

Copper, like the coin in his hand.

Somewhere out there, beyond those moons, beyond the familiar sky, the universe waited. Ships traveled between stars carrying Ferengi merchants and Bolian tourists and silent Vulcans. Adventures happened. Stories were written.

And someday, Morn knew with absolute certainty, he would be part of them.

He fell asleep with the coin pressed against his chest, dreaming of profit in the wind.
