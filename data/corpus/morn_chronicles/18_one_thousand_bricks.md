# Chapter 18: One Thousand Bricks

The weight was wrong.

Morn had carried latinum in his kelvu before—small amounts, personal reserves, the occasional transport job that paid better than bartending. He knew the sensation of liquid metal settling against the walls of his secondary stomach, the way it shifted when he moved, the faint warmth of it against his internal organs.

This was different.

One thousand bricks worth of liquid latinum pressed against him from the inside, a dense mass that seemed to anchor him to whatever surface he occupied. Standing required effort. Walking required concentration. Breathing required negotiation with the weight that pushed against his diaphragm from below.

Three days in Hain's safehouse, and Morn had barely moved from the reinforced chair in the corner of the main room. He sat there now, watching the others through half-lidded eyes, trying to ignore the persistent ache that radiated from his center.

The safehouse occupied the basement level of a textile warehouse in Bolias City's industrial district. Hain had prepared it months ago—soundproofed walls, independent power supply, enough provisions for a week. The air recyclers hummed constantly, a white noise that did nothing to mask the tension building between the five of them.

"How much longer?" Krit asked, not for the first time that morning.

Hain didn't look up from the data tablet he'd been studying for the past hour. "The deposit is scheduled for tomorrow. After that, we wait another three days for the trail to cool."

"Three more days." Nahsk's voice carried the same edge as his brother's. "Sitting in this hole."

"Would you prefer a holding cell?" Hain's tone remained mild, almost pleasant. "The Bolian authorities are still interviewing witnesses. The Kressari delegation has filed seventeen separate complaints. There are investigators from four different agencies trying to determine how someone walked out of the most secure vault on the planet with a thousand bricks of latinum."

He finally looked up, his pale eyes moving from Krit to Nahsk with measured patience.

"Three days is nothing. We knew this going in."

Morn watched the exchange from his corner. The Yridian brothers had grown increasingly restless since they'd arrived at the safehouse, pacing the confined space like caged animals. They weren't built for waiting. Neither was Morn, normally—but movement had become its own kind of suffering.

Larell appeared at his side, a cup of something warm in her hands. "Ginger tea," she said, settling onto the arm of his chair. "It might help with the nausea."

Morn accepted the cup but didn't drink. His appetite had vanished the moment the last of the latinum had entered his kelvu, replaced by a constant low-grade queasiness that food only seemed to aggravate. He'd managed a few bites of bland nutrition paste yesterday, and even that had sat uneasily alongside the metal mass within him.

"You need to eat something," Larell said, her voice low enough that the others wouldn't hear. "You're losing color."

She was right. Morn had caught his reflection in the refresher mirror that morning and barely recognized himself. His skin had taken on a grayish pallor, and dark circles had formed beneath his eyes. The physical toll of carrying this much latinum was more severe than he'd anticipated.

More severe than any of them had anticipated, perhaps. Or exactly as severe as Hain had calculated.

"Tomorrow," Morn said, the single word requiring more effort than it should have. "After the deposit."

Larell nodded, but her hand found his shoulder and stayed there—a gesture that might have been comfort, or might have been something else entirely.

---

The Bank of Bolias occupied a tower of blue glass and white stone in the heart of the financial district. Morn watched the building through the safehouse's single small window, a viewport that Hain had installed specifically for this purpose. From here, they could see the main entrance, the security checkpoints, the steady flow of customers and employees.

They could watch Hain walk through the front door carrying a case full of worthless gold.

"He's inside," Krit announced, stating the obvious.

The gold-pressed latinum shells—now containing nothing but hollow gold—would be deposited in a new account under a fabricated identity. The paperwork would be impeccable, the credentials flawless. Investigators searching for the stolen latinum would eventually trace the deposit, spend weeks unraveling the false identity, and discover nothing but empty shells.

By then, the real latinum would be long gone. Distributed, laundered, untraceable.

The real latinum that currently sat in Morn's kelvu like a stone.

"Thirty minutes," Nahsk said, checking his chrono. "That's what he estimated."

Thirty-two minutes later, Hain emerged from the bank's main entrance. Even from this distance, Morn could read the satisfaction in his posture—the slight loosening of his shoulders, the unhurried pace of his stride. The deposit had gone smoothly.

One piece of the plan complete. One step closer to the split.

---

That evening, they gathered around the safehouse's central table for the first time since arriving. Hain had prepared a meal—nothing elaborate, but real food rather than emergency rations. A peace offering, perhaps. Or a celebration.

Morn sat at the far end, the cup of ginger tea untouched before him. The others ate with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Krit and Nahsk attacked their portions like men who'd been starving, which in a sense they had—the tension of the past few days had dampened everyone's appetite. Larell picked at her food, her attention divided between her plate and Morn.

Hain ate methodically, his movements precise and unhurried.

"The deposit is done," he said between bites. "The false trail is laid. Now we discuss distribution."

The word hung in the air. Distribution. The moment they'd all been waiting for, working toward, risking everything to achieve.

One thousand bricks. Five partners. Two hundred each.

"The split is straightforward," Hain continued. "Equal shares, as agreed. The question is logistics."

"The logistics are sitting right there." Krit jerked his chin toward Morn. "He's got it all inside him. He extracts, we divide, we go our separate ways."

"Extraction takes time," Hain said mildly. "The kelvu wasn't designed to expel this volume quickly. Forcing the process could cause internal damage."

"How much time?" Nahsk asked.

Hain looked at Morn, and for the first time since the heist, Morn felt the full weight of his attention. Not hostile. Not threatening. Just... calculating.

"Several days, at minimum. Perhaps a week for the full amount."

Krit made a sound of disgust. "A week. Another week in this hole, waiting for him to—" He gestured vaguely. "What, regurgitate our shares?"

"The kelvu expels through a specialized duct," Morn said, the longest sentence he'd managed in days. "Not the esophagus."

"I don't care about the anatomy lesson." Krit leaned forward, his eyes fixed on Morn. "I care about getting my share and getting off this planet."

"We all want the same thing," Larell said, and there was something sharp in her voice that Morn hadn't heard before. "Pushing him won't make it happen faster."

"No one's pushing anyone." Hain's mild tone cut through the rising tension. "We proceed carefully, methodically, exactly as planned. Morn begins extraction tomorrow. We divide as he produces. Within a week, we'll have our shares and our freedom."

The logic was sound. The plan was clear. And yet, as Morn looked around the table at his partners—his supposed partners—he felt something cold settling in his chest alongside the weight in his kelvu.

They weren't looking at him like a partner.

Krit's eyes held calculation, measuring Morn like a problem to be solved. Nahsk watched with barely concealed impatience, his fingers tapping against the table in an irregular rhythm. Hain observed with that same careful attention, the expression of a man monitoring an investment.

And Larell...

Larell met his gaze, and her expression softened into something that might have been concern. But she hadn't left his side in three days. She'd brought him tea, checked on his condition, positioned herself between him and the Yridian brothers whenever tension rose.

Protecting him? Or guarding him?

The distinction mattered more than Morn wanted to admit.

---

That night, alone in the small room Hain had designated as his quarters, Morn began the extraction process.

It wasn't the physical act that hurt—not really. The kelvu was designed for this, and the specialized duct responded to the right combination of muscle contractions and biochemical triggers. The liquid latinum flowed, slowly but steadily, into the container he'd positioned beneath him.

What hurt was watching it go.

Each drop that left his body represented something more than currency. For days, he'd carried a fortune inside him—a weight that was also, in some perverse way, a kind of security. As long as the latinum remained in his kelvu, he remained necessary. Essential. The crew couldn't complete the job without him.

But every drop he extracted brought the inevitable split closer. And after the split...

Morn stared at the thin stream of silver-white liquid, watching his own relevance drain away.

He'd been recruited for his kelvu. He understood that now, with a clarity that the excitement of the heist had obscured. His species' biological quirk, his unusual capacity, his willingness to participate—those were the qualities that had made him valuable to Hain's plan.

Not his skills. Not his judgment. Not his partnership.

His stomach.

The extraction continued, drop by drop, until fatigue forced him to stop. He sealed the container—perhaps fifty bricks worth, a modest beginning—and sat in the darkness of his small room, feeling the remaining weight shift inside him.

Nine hundred and fifty bricks still to go. Nine hundred and fifty more reasons for the crew to keep him alive and cooperative.

After that?

Morn thought about the way Krit and Nahsk watched him, the impatience barely concealed behind their eyes. He thought about Hain's careful calculations, the way the Bolian planned for every contingency. He thought about Larell, always close, always attentive, her presence equal parts comfort and uncertainty.

He'd wanted to be part of something. A crew, a partnership, a venture that would lift him beyond the quiet desperation of serving drinks on a backwater station. He'd wanted to matter.

And he did matter. For now.

But containers, Morn realized with dawning horror, only mattered until they were empty.

The safehouse seemed smaller than before, the walls pressing in, the recycled air harder to breathe. Somewhere beyond the soundproofed walls, the city continued its business—people working, living, trusting that tomorrow would be much like today.

Morn sat in the darkness with a fortune still inside him and the growing certainty that he'd made a terrible mistake.
