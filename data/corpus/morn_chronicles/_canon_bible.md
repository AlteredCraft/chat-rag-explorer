## Part One: Lurian Biology

### Lifespan and Aging

Lurians are exceptionally long-lived, with natural lifespans of 300-350 years. They age in distinct phases:

| Phase | Age Range | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Infant | 0-5 | Dependent, rapid growth |
| Child | 5-25 | Learning, pre-molt |
| Adolescent | 25-40 | Post-First Molt, apprenticeship |
| Young Adult | 40-80 | Independence, career building |
| Prime | 80-200 | Peak capability, family leadership |
| Elder | 200-300 | Wisdom roles, reduced activity |
| Ancient | 300+ | Rare, venerated |

**Morn's Age**: Born approximately 2215, making him ~154 years old when arriving at Terok Nor (2369) and ~159 during the DS9 series proper. He is in his Prime phase.

### Dual Stomach System

Lurians possess two distinct stomachs:

1. **Primary Stomach (Gorvu)**: Standard digestive organ, processes food
2. **Secondary Stomach (Kelvu)**: Storage organ with the following properties:
   - Muscular, expandable pouch located behind the primary stomach
   - Lined with an inert membrane resistant to corrosive substances
   - Can hold up to 3 liters of liquid or equivalent solid mass
   - Contents can be retained indefinitely with conscious control
   - Retrieval requires deliberate muscular contraction (uncomfortable but not painful)
   - Originally evolved for storing water during Luria's dry seasons

**The Latinum**: Morn stored approximately 100 liters of liquid latinum in his kelvu over the course of several years, expanding the organ beyond its natural capacity. This caused chronic discomfort and contributed to his hair loss due to metabolic stress.

### Hair and Appearance

- Lurians naturally have thick, fibrous hair covering their heads and upper shoulders
- Hair color ranges from deep auburn to silvery grey
- Hair loss is considered deeply embarrassing in Lurian culture
- Morn's hair fell out gradually between 2366-2370 due to latinum storage stress
- He was indeed "quite handsome" by Lurian standards in his youth

### Molting (The First Molt)

Between ages 30-35, Lurians undergo a biological transformation called the First Molt:

- Outer skin layer sheds over a period of 2-3 weeks
- New skin emerges with adult coloration and texture
- Secondary stomach reaches full functionality
- Hormonal changes trigger psychological maturation
- Considered the transition from child to adult
- Accompanied by significant cultural ceremonies

### Other Biological Notes

- **Hearing**: Lurians have excellent low-frequency hearing
- **Vision**: Slightly better night vision than humans, narrower color spectrum
- **Voice**: Deep, resonant voices with wide tonal range; capable of extended vocalization
- **Sleep**: Require only 4-5 hours per day; often nap in short intervals
- **Diet**: Omnivorous, preference for high-protein foods; enjoy fermented beverages

## Part Two: Lurian Culture and Society

### The Warren System

Lurians organize into extended family units called Warrens:

- A Warren consists of 3-7 generations living in interconnected dwellings
- Average Warren size: 80-200 individuals
- Warrens are named for their founding matriarch
- Multiple Warrens form a District; multiple Districts form a Hive-City

**Morn's Warren**: The Galorum Warren, founded by his great-great-grandmother Galorum the Steady, a renowned trade negotiator. The Warren specializes in off-world commerce and shipping.

### Family Structure

- **Matriarchal Influence**: Eldest females hold significant advisory power
- **Child-Rearing**: Communal; all adults share responsibility for all children
- **Siblings**: Large sibling groups (10-20) are common
- **Naming**: Children receive provisional names at birth, true names at First Molt

### Morn's Siblings (17 Total, Birth Order)

1. **Torvak** (m, ~2180) - Eldest brother, Warren administrator, stern and responsible
2. **Kellura** (f, ~2185) - Eldest sister, trade negotiator, warm but demanding
3. **Brossik** (m, ~2190) - Engineer, quiet, inventive
4. **Nalenna** (f, ~2192) - Teacher, patient, beloved by young ones
5. **Durvo** (m, ~2195) - Pilot, adventurous, Morn's early idol
6. **Tessik** (f, ~2197) - Artist, dreamy, impractical
7. **Vornak** (m, ~2199) - Merchant, shrewd, often clashed with Morn
8. **Kelloss** (m, ~2201) - Twin to Mellura, mediator
9. **Mellura** (f, ~2201) - Twin to Kelloss, historian
10. **Prenna** (f, ~2203) - Healer, gentle, Morn's confidante
11. **Thurrik** (m, ~2205) - Hauler captain, competitive
12. **Garenna** (f, ~2207) - Cook, fierce, ran the Warren kitchen
13. **Bolvus** (m, ~2209) - Scholar, reclusive, allergic to adventure
14. **Drennik** (m, ~2211) - Troublemaker, funny, got Morn into scrapes
15. **Solura** (f, ~2212) - Singer, performed at ceremonies
16. **Verrik** (m, ~2214) - Closest in age to Morn, quiet rival
17. **Morn** (m, ~2215) - The protagonist
18. **Tessanna** (f, ~2218) - Youngest, the baby everyone spoiled

### Naming Conventions

- **Birth Name**: Simple, provisional, given by mother (Morn's was "Mornik")
- **True Name**: Chosen at First Molt, announced at ceremony
- **Warren Name**: Galorum (used formally: "Morn of Galorum")
- **The Dropping of Syllables**: As Lurians age, their names often shorten; "Mornik" became "Morn" long before his True Name ceremony, and he kept it

### Trade and Commerce

Lurians are renowned traders throughout the Alpha Quadrant:

- **Trade Guilds**: Regulate commerce, set standards, resolve disputes
- **The Trade Tongue**: A simplified commercial language used across species
- **Reputation Economy**: A trader's word is their bond; breaking faith is catastrophic
- **Shipping Clans**: Extended families operating trade fleets
- **The Galorum Fleet**: Morn's family operates 12 vessels (at the story's start)

### Religion and Philosophy

Lurians practice a loose philosophical tradition rather than organized religion:

- **The Turning**: Belief in cycles of fortune; patience through hardship
- **The Long View**: With 300-year lifespans, Lurians value patience
- **Ancestor Respect**: Past matriarchs are honored but not worshipped
- **Luck Traditions**: Various superstitions around commerce and travel

### Architecture

- **Warren Compounds**: Interconnected buildings around central courtyards
- **Underground Levels**: Sleeping quarters and storage below ground (cooler)
- **Common Halls**: Large spaces for meals, gatherings, celebrations
- **Personal Alcoves**: Small private spaces within shared quarters
- **Hive-Cities**: Dense urban centers with warrens stacked vertically

## Part Five: Timeline

### Pre-Story

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| ~2180 | Torvak (eldest sibling) born |
| ~2215 | Morn born as 18th child |
| ~2230 | Morn's First Molt |
| ~2235 | Morn begins apprenticeship in family shipping |
| ~2250 | Morn takes first solo command |
| ~2260 | Morn leaves Warren for independent shipping |

### Story Events

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| ~2280 | Morn meets Hain; crew forms over next years |
| 2365 | **Lissepian Mother's Day Heist** |
| 2365-66 | Morn flees with latinum; crew pursues |
| ~2364 | Morn arrives at Terok Nor (Cardassian station) |
| 2366 | Hair begins falling out (latinum stress) |
| 2369 | Federation takes over; station becomes DS9 |
| 2369-75 | DS9 series events; Morn is a fixture |
| 2373-75 | Dominion War |
| 2374 | "Who Mourns for Morn?" events |
| 2375 | War ends; Morn remains at DS9 |

### Note on the Timeline Discrepancy

Canon states Morn arrived at Terok Nor "around 2364" but the heist was "2365." This story reconciles by:
- Morn first visited Terok Nor briefly in 2364
- The heist occurred in 2365
- Morn fled to Terok Nor permanently after the betrayal (late 2365/early 2366)
- He became a fixture there before the Federation arrived (2369)

## Part Seven: Tone and Style Guidelines

### Overall Tone

- The irony that we "hear" him extensively but DS9 viewers never did

- The weight of secrets carried for decades

### Things to Avoid
- Gratuitous violence or dark content
- Romantic/sexual content beyond PG implications
- Real-world political allegories
- Breaking established Star Trek canon
- Morn speaking on-screen during DS9 timeline (maintain the joke)

### Chapter Structure
- ~2,000-2,500 words each
- Open with grounding detail (setting, sensory)
- End with hook or resonant image
- Include at least one moment of humor per chapter
- Include at least one moment of emotional weight per chapter
