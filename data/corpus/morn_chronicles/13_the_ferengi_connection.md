# Chapter 13: The Ferengi Connection

The rain on Ferenginar fell in sheets so thick that Morn sometimes wondered if the planet had simply decided to become an ocean and was working its way there one storm at a time. He stood under the awning of a commerce exchange, watching rivers cascade down the street while Ferengi splashed past in their waterproof boots, not even glancing up. To them, this was just weather. To Morn, it was a kind of miracle—a world so committed to its own nature that it refused to apologize for drowning its visitors.

He had been coming here regularly for three years now, ever since his business with the Commerce Authority had evolved from occasional necessity to genuine preference. The Ferengi made sense to him in ways that other species often didn't. They wanted profit. They said so. They built their entire civilization around the admission of that want, codified it into rules, celebrated it openly. After decades of navigating the polite fictions of Federation diplomacy and the elaborate hierarchies of Klingon honor, Morn found something almost restful about a culture that simply stated its intentions.

"You're blocking the doorway," a Ferengi said, pushing past him. No apology, no softening phrase. Just the fact and the correction.

Morn stepped aside, nodding his acknowledgment. The Ferengi was already gone, disappearing into the rain without a backward glance.

That was another thing he appreciated. No one on Ferenginar expected him to perform social rituals he didn't feel. A nod was sufficient. Silence was acceptable. Commerce was the only conversation that truly mattered, and Morn had become fluent in its grammar.

The Commerce Authority building rose seventeen stories above the financial district, its windows dark with accumulated grime that no one bothered to clean because cleaning cost latinum and didn't increase profits. Morn had an office there—not officially, but a desk that was always empty when he arrived, a chair that had molded itself to his considerable frame, and a terminal that remembered his preferences.

Gliv, his primary contact, had arranged it years ago. "You bring us good business," Gliv had said, as if that explained everything. And on Ferenginar, it did.

Today Morn was reviewing cargo manifests for a shipment of self-sealing stem bolts bound for the Cardassian border. Legitimate goods, legitimate buyer, legitimate profit margin. The kind of work that kept his license clean and his reputation solid. He had learned early that the best cover for occasional gray-market activities was an overwhelming volume of completely legal ones.

"Rule of Acquisition Forty-Seven," Gliv said, appearing at his elbow with two cups of something that might charitably be called tea. "Don't trust a man wearing a better suit than your own."

Morn looked down at his practical jumpsuit, then at Gliv's ostentatiously tailored jacket with its gold threading and gem-studded clasps.

"I should be suspicious of you then," he said.

Gliv's ears twitched—the Ferengi equivalent of a broad grin. "You should be suspicious of everyone. That's Rule Twenty-Three: Nothing is more important than your health—except for your money." He handed Morn one of the cups. "But I'll make an exception for you. You've been good for business, and that makes you almost trustworthy."

Almost. Morn appreciated the qualifier. Absolute trust was a fairy tale, and the Ferengi didn't believe in fairy tales unless they could be monetized.

The bar was called The Dividend, and it occupied a narrow slice of real estate between a currency exchange and a bankruptcy processing center. Prime location, Brek assured him, because desperate people on both sides would need drinks.

Brek himself was young for a Ferengi—barely into his fifties—with ears that hadn't quite grown into their full potential and a nervous energy that manifested in constant motion. He polished glasses that were already clean, rearranged bottles that didn't need rearranging, and talked with the fervent enthusiasm of someone who had just discovered their life's purpose.

"I'm not staying on Ferenginar," he said, pouring Morn a glass of something blue and moderately alcoholic. "Too much competition. A thousand bars within walking distance, all of them owned by Ferengi who've been in the business for centuries. No, I'm going to the frontier. Remote stations, border outposts. Places where people are desperate for something familiar."

Morn sipped his drink and nodded.

"There's a station near the Bajoran sector—old Cardassian construction, they say it's going to become important. Mining, trade routes, something political." Brek waved vaguely, as if the details were irrelevant. "What matters is it'll have people. Travelers, workers, maybe military. All of them far from home. All of them needing somewhere to spend their latinum."

"What will you offer them?" Morn asked.

Brek looked at him as if the question were absurd. "Drinks. Gambling. Holosuites when I can afford the equipment. The usual."

"But what will make them come back?"

The young Ferengi paused, glass in hand. "The drinks will be good. The gambling will be fair—or fair enough. The holosuites will be—"

"Available everywhere," Morn said. "Any station with power has replicators. Any station with space has gambling. You need something else."

Brek's ears flattened slightly—confusion, not offense. "Something else?"

Morn thought about all the bars he'd visited across three quadrants. The ones that became homes away from home and the ones that remained interchangeable stopping points. The difference wasn't always obvious, but it was always present.

"You need to make people feel welcome," he said. "Not as customers. As guests."

"Guests don't pay."

"Guests pay more than customers," Morn said. "Customers buy what they need and leave. Guests stay. They come back. They bring friends. They feel ownership—not of the bar, but of their place in it. Their stool. Their drink. Their seat at the dabo table."

Brek was listening now, really listening, his constant motion stilled.

"A customer is a transaction," Morn continued. "A guest is a relationship. Relationships compound. Rule of Acquisition—"

"Two-Eighty-Nine," Brek said automatically. "A friend in need is a potential customer." He frowned. "But you're saying something different."

"I'm saying that a friend in need who trusts you will spend more, stay longer, and tell others to do the same. Profit follows loyalty, but loyalty doesn't follow profit."

The young Ferengi was quiet for a long moment, turning the glass in his hands.

"That sounds dangerously close to charity," he said finally.

Morn smiled. "It sounds like good business to anyone paying attention."

He didn't know if Brek would take the advice. The young Ferengi had profit in his eyes and ambition in his heart, and those were powerful forces that often drowned out subtler wisdom. But Morn had planted the seed. Whether it grew was someone else's story.

The job from Hain came through standard channels—a message to his Commerce Authority terminal, encrypted with the key they'd established months ago. Simple transport work: three cases of Bolian crystal art from a collector on Ferenginar to a buyer on Rigel VII. Legitimate goods, documented provenance, all fees and tariffs pre-paid. The kind of job that required a reliable captain with a fast ship and no questions asked.

Morn had questions, of course. He always had questions. But he'd learned when to ask them and when to let silence do the work.

The pickup was smooth. The cases were exactly as described—Bolian crystals, genuinely beautiful, genuinely valuable, genuinely legal. The seller was a retired Ferengi merchant who talked too much about his dead wife and not enough about why he was selling pieces she had loved. Morn listened to the stories, accepted the cargo, and departed without incident.

The delivery was equally unremarkable. A Rigellian art dealer, establishment and refined, who inspected each crystal with professional care before transferring the agreed payment. No hidden signals, no complications, no shadows in doorways.

Just a job. Completely clean.

Which was, of course, the point.

Morn recognized the test for what it was. Hain wanted to see if he could follow instructions, handle legitimate work without drawing attention, and resist the temptation to cut corners or seek advantage. It was the first step in a longer dance—trust built through demonstration, intimacy earned through reliability.

He sent his completion report to Hain and waited.

Three days later, the invitation came.

---

The restaurant occupied the top floor of a tower that Morn hadn't known existed until tonight. No external signage, no public listings, no acknowledgment in any directory he could access. Just an address in Hain's message and a doorway that opened when he approached.

Inside, the space was designed for privacy. Each table occupied its own acoustic bubble, sounds absorbed by materials that probably cost more than Morn's ship. Soft lighting, real food (not replicated—he could tell by the imperfections), and staff who moved like ghosts and remembered nothing.

Hain rose to greet him, wearing clothes that managed to be simple and obviously expensive at the same time.

"Morn. Thank you for coming." His handshake was warm, his smile genuine. "I've ordered the tasting menu. I hope you don't mind."

Morn sat, taking in the room with practiced awareness. Two other occupied tables, both far enough away that observation was impossible. No visible security, which meant security he couldn't see. Exits at three points, all of them requiring passage through the main dining area.

"The crystal delivery went well," Hain said, as if discussing weather. "The buyer was pleased. He asked about future shipments."

"I'm available."

"I know." Hain's smile had layers. "That's why you're here. I have more work, if you're interested. Similar jobs at first—legitimate cargo, straightforward routes. But eventually, there may be opportunities that require more... discretion."

"I've been discreet before."

"Yes, you have. That's also why you're here."

The first course arrived—something Morn didn't recognize, prepared in a style he couldn't identify, and more delicious than it had any right to be. They ate in companionable silence for a few minutes, and Morn found himself relaxing despite his instincts.

Hain had that effect on people. Morn knew it was calculated—everything about the man was calculated—but knowing didn't diminish its power. Some people radiated trust the way stars radiated light: automatically, constantly, and with effects that didn't depend on understanding their source.

They were halfway through the third course when she arrived.

"Morn, I'd like you to meet someone." Hain rose again, his attention shifting to the woman approaching their table. "This is Larell. She facilitates connections for me. Doors that need opening, relationships that need managing. She's very good at her work."

Larell smiled, and something shifted in Morn's chest.

She was humanoid, though he couldn't immediately identify her species—features that might have been Trill without the spots, coloring that suggested Betazoid without the black eyes, movement that spoke of combat training disguised as grace. Beautiful in a way that felt almost beside the point, like noticing the frame of a window when the view itself commanded attention.

"Morn," she said, and his name in her voice sounded different. Heavier. More significant. "Hain has told me about you. The listening one."

"I hope the description was favorable."

"It was intriguing." She took the seat Hain pulled out for her, settling into the space between them with the ease of someone who belonged everywhere. "He said you understand people without needing them to explain themselves. That you read the gaps in conversations more fluently than the words."

"Hain is generous with his observations."

"Hain is rarely generous with anything unless it serves a purpose." She glanced at the man in question, her tone affectionate enough to soften the edge. "But he's accurate. I've checked your reputation across three sectors. People trust you, even when they can't explain why. That's not a common quality."

"It's a useful one."

"Very." Her eyes met his, and Morn felt the weight of evaluation behind them. She was testing him too—not like Hain's cargo test, but something subtler. She was measuring whether the man matched the reputation.

"What exactly does facilitating connections involve?" he asked.

"Making introductions. Identifying mutual interests. Occasionally removing obstacles that prevent productive arrangements." She smiled again, and it was a different smile this time—less professional, more genuine. "Think of me as a translator, but for intentions rather than languages. People say what they want; I help them see what they need. And then I introduce them to someone who can provide it."

"Like Hain is introducing us."

"Exactly like that."

They talked through the remaining courses, and Morn found himself sharing more than he'd intended. She asked questions that opened doors he normally kept locked—not about his business or his past, but about what he wanted. What mattered. What he was building toward with all the flying and the cargo and the carefully accumulated connections.

He didn't have good answers. He'd never thought about his life as building toward anything. But Larell listened to his silences the way he listened to others', and when she spoke, her words fit into spaces he hadn't known were empty.

At the evening's end, Hain excused himself with the practiced grace of a man who knew when to become invisible.

"I'll be in contact about the next job," he said, clasping Morn's shoulder. "In the meantime, Larell will be your primary contact for anything you need. She's authorized to speak for me in all matters."

And then he was gone, and they were alone in the acoustic bubble, the restaurant's ambient noise a distant murmur that might as well have been another galaxy.

"He's not subtle," Larell said, her smile acknowledging the orchestration. "But he's not wrong either. I did want to meet you. The wanting just happened to align with his purposes."

"And what do you want?"

She considered the question with the seriousness it deserved.

"I want to know if you're as interesting as your reputation suggests. The verdict is still pending." She rose, and Morn rose with her, the gravity of her movement pulling him along. "But I'm inclined toward a favorable judgment."

She touched his arm as she passed—brief, deliberate, electric.

"I'll be in contact," she said. "About the work. And perhaps about other things."

Then she was gone, and Morn was alone with the ghost of her touch and the unfamiliar sensation of wanting something he couldn't name.

Outside, the rain had stopped. Ferenginar had decided to grant a temporary reprieve, the clouds parting to reveal unfamiliar stars. Morn walked back to his ship through streets that glistened with reflected light, and he didn't notice the puddles soaking through his boots.

He was thinking about Larell's smile, and the way it had reached her eyes, and the way that reaching had felt like the beginning of a story he desperately wanted to read.

He didn't notice the web tightening around him.

He wouldn't—not for years.

But the threads were there, woven with care by hands that knew their craft, and every step he took toward the light drew him deeper into the design.
