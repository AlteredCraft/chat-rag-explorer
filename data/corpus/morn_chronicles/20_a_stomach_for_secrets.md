# Chapter 20: A Stomach for Secrets

The *Patient Ear* dropped out of warp in an unnamed system, and Morn immediately began scanning for other vessels. Nothing. Just rocks and radiation and the distant cold light of a dying star.

He allowed himself to breathe.

This was the seventeenth system in eleven days. Or was it twelve days? He'd stopped keeping careful track. Sleep came in fragments now—twenty minutes here, an hour there, always with one eye on the sensor display. The ship's computer had logged forty-seven course changes since he'd fled the rendezvous point, each one erasing another piece of his trail.

He hoped.

The transponder code read *Venture's Promise* now, registered to a Bolian freighter captain who'd died three years ago. Morn had found the registration in a data packet he'd bought from a Yridian information dealer at a fuel depot near the Badlands. The Yridian hadn't asked questions. Yridians never did—not when the payment was good and the buyer looked desperate enough to kill.

Morn wondered if he'd looked desperate. He certainly felt it.

He ran his hand over his scalp and felt the stubble there, the patches where hair still clung in defiant clumps. More had fallen out this morning. He'd found it on his pillow, on the deck plates, floating in the recycled air like gray snow. The kelvu was doing this. Seventeen kilograms of liquid latinum pressed against organs that had never evolved to carry such weight, leaching toxins into his bloodstream, stealing nutrients his body needed.

He'd read about the side effects in the old Lurian medical texts. Hair loss. Digestive problems. Chronic fatigue. Mood instability. The kelvu was meant for short-term storage—days, maybe weeks. He'd been carrying this fortune for over a year now, and his body was beginning to rebel.

He picked up the sonic razor and stared at his reflection in the dormitory's small mirror. The face that looked back was gaunt, the eyes hollow, the remaining hair a mockery of what he'd once had.

"Might as well," he said to no one.

The razor hummed as he drew it across his scalp. Clumps of gray fell away, revealing the pale skin beneath. He worked methodically, erasing the last traces of who he'd been. When he finished, the stranger in the mirror was bald, tired, and utterly unremarkable.

Good.

He needed to be unremarkable now. He needed to be forgettable, invisible, a face in the crowd that no one would remember five minutes after he'd passed. The Morn who'd laughed with Hain over drinks, who'd trusted too easily, who'd believed he'd finally found a family—that Morn had to die so this one could survive.

---

The weeks blurred together.

He moved through the shipping lanes like a ghost, never staying anywhere longer than it took to refuel. He avoided Lurian space entirely—they'd be watching for him there, and his people had obligations to cooperate with legitimate inquiries. His mother would have to answer questions. His brothers would have to claim ignorance. Better to stay away, to let them truthfully say they hadn't seen him, hadn't heard from him, didn't know where he'd gone.

He thought about Larell.

He thought about her constantly, actually, in the quiet hours between systems when there was nothing to do but monitor the autopilot and try not to go mad. She appeared in his dreams—her dark hair falling across his chest, her voice low in his ear, her hands tracing patterns on his skin that spelled out words he'd been too foolish to read.

*Where did you get your kelvu modified?*

She'd asked him that, early on. He'd thought she was curious. He'd thought she was interested in his culture, his biology, his uniqueness. He'd told her about the surgeon on Bolarus, about the illegal procedure, about how it had hurt but been worth it for the security it provided.

She'd filed that information away. Stored it for later. Reported it to Hain.

*You're different from the others*, she'd said. *You see people. You care.*

Had she meant it? Had any part of what they'd shared been real?

Morn stared at the stars streaking past and felt the latinum shift inside him as the ship changed vector. Seventeen kilograms of betrayal, and he was the only one who'd have to carry it forever.

---

He could extract it.

The thought occurred to him somewhere around week six, drifting through a debris field near the Cardassian border. He had the medical supplies. He had the surgical knowledge—or at least enough of it to manage the procedure if he was careful. He could find a moon somewhere, an asteroid, a place no one would ever look. He could bury the latinum and walk away light for the first time in over a year.

He spent three days planning it. He mapped out the procedure, identified suitable hiding locations, calculated the risks.

Then he imagined Hain's face when they found the empty vault.

No. They wouldn't stop. The latinum was worth too much, and more importantly, he knew too much. He could identify all of them. He could testify to their crimes. Even if he gave up the fortune, they'd still need him dead to protect themselves.

And worse—any hiding spot he could find, they could find too. Given enough time, enough resources, enough motivation. The latinum would sit there in some forgotten corner of the galaxy, waiting to be discovered, and Morn would spend the rest of his life wondering when the knock would come.

His kelvu was the only vault no one could crack. The only safe he controlled completely. The only hiding place that moved with him, thought with him, fought with him.

They couldn't take it without killing him.

He wasn't entirely certain they wouldn't.

---

The paranoia was the worst part.

Every ship that appeared on sensors became a potential threat. Every face in every port might be someone Hain had hired. Every communication, every transaction, every momentary lapse in attention could be the mistake that got him killed.

He stopped talking to people. Not because he had nothing to say—Morn had always had plenty to say—but because every conversation was a risk. Names could be remembered. Descriptions could be passed along. A Lurian who talked too much was a Lurian who could be found.

So he sat in silence. He nursed single drinks for hours. He watched and listened and said nothing, and people assumed he was simple, or shy, or just not worth their attention.

Let them assume. Assumptions kept you alive.

---

He replayed his conversations with Hain in the empty hours.

*Tell me about the kelvu. How does it work?*

That had been early, when they were still building trust. Morn had been flattered by the interest. Most non-Lurians found the whole thing slightly disgusting—the idea of a second stomach, of storing things inside your body, of the modifications required to carry more than biology intended. But Hain had seemed genuinely curious.

*You must trust your crew*, Hain had said, *to let them know you're carrying.*

And Morn had nodded, feeling warm and included, feeling like he'd finally found people who accepted him as he was.

*The others don't need to know the details*, Hain had said later, when it was just the two of them. *But I should. In case something happens to you. Someone needs to know how to help.*

So Morn had explained. The capacity. The extraction process. The medical risks. The way the kelvu could be forced to expel its contents under the right circumstances.

He'd given Hain the manual to his own vault.

Stupid. So impossibly, catastrophically stupid.

But loneliness did that to you. It made you want to believe. It made you see family where there were only predators, see trust where there was only calculation. He'd wanted so badly to belong to something that he'd ignored every warning sign, every inconsistency, every moment when Hain's eyes had been just a little too calculating.

The signs had been there. They were always there, looking back. But you couldn't see them when you were standing in the middle of the trap, too grateful for the warmth to notice the walls closing in.

He arrived at the Cardassian mining station on a Tuesday. Or what passed for Tuesday in this sector—time was measured differently here, in shifts and quotas and the endless rhythm of ore extraction.

Terok Nor hung against the stars like a mechanical spider, all pylons and docking rings and the brutal functionality of Cardassian engineering. It was ugly. It was remote. It was exactly what he needed.

The Cardassians didn't ask questions. They didn't care who you were or where you came from, as long as you had currency and didn't cause problems. This was a mining operation, not a community. People came and went. People disappeared. The only thing that mattered was the ore flowing down to Bajor and the profits flowing up to Cardassia.

Morn docked the *Patient Ear* in a rental bay and paid three months in advance. The Cardassian administrator looked at his latinum—real latinum, not the liquid kind he carried inside him—and processed the paperwork without comment.

"Welcome to Terok Nor," the administrator said, already looking past him to the next arrival.

Morn walked through the corridors and felt something he hadn't felt in months.

Safe.

Not completely safe. Not safe enough to sleep without one eye open or to trust the faces around him. But safer than he'd been in the open, jumping from system to system, waiting for the moment when a familiar ship would appear on his sensors and end his flight permanently.

Here, he could disappear. Here, he could become one more unremarkable face in a station full of miners and merchants and people who'd come here specifically to avoid being found.

---

The bar was on the Promenade, run by a Ferengi who'd somehow convinced the Cardassians to let him operate here. Morn had heard about Ferengi bars—overpriced drinks, questionable holosuites, and a constant stream of schemes and propositions. But he needed a drink, and more importantly, he needed to see the kind of place this was.

He sat at the end of the bar, away from the other patrons, and waited.

The bartender appeared almost immediately. He was short even for a Ferengi, with an elaborate pattern of lobes and an expression that suggested he was already calculating how much profit this interaction might yield.

"New face," the Ferengi said. "I'm Quark. I own this establishment. What can I get you?"

Morn pointed at a bottle behind the bar.

"That? Good taste. Not cheap taste, but good taste." Quark poured the drink and slid it across the counter. "You have a name, or should I just call you 'the quiet Lurian who sits at my bar'?"

Morn said nothing. He picked up the glass and drank.

Quark studied him for a moment, those calculating eyes taking in the shaved head, the hollow cheeks, the bone-deep exhaustion that no amount of rest would cure. Then he shrugged.

"Suit yourself. You need anything, you ask. Anything at all. Quark's has everything." He flashed a wide, sharp smile. "For a price."

He moved away to serve another customer, and Morn sat alone with his drink and his seventeen kilograms of secrets.

The bar was warm. The ambient noise washed over him like water. No one was looking for him here. No one cared who he was or what he carried.

He ordered another drink. Then another.

The Promenade moved around him—Cardassian soldiers, Bajoran workers, a handful of other species who'd found their way to this distant corner of the galaxy. Life continuing. The universe spinning on without any awareness of the fortune sitting in a Lurian's modified stomach at the end of a Ferengi's bar.

Morn finished his drink and stared at the empty glass.

He didn't plan to leave.
