# Chapter 10: Independence

The Patient Ear was not much of a ship.

Morn had bought her from a Tellarite salvager who'd been honest enough to list her flaws—a rarity in the trade—and then added fifteen percent to the price for his honesty. She was a Yridian courier vessel, thirty years old, with an engine that wheezed at warp four and hull plating that showed the scars of a dozen patch jobs. Her previous owner had painted her name on the hull in Federation Standard, the letters slightly crooked: *The Patient Ear*.

Morn had kept the name. It suited him.

For five years now, this ship had been his home. Not Warren—nothing could be Warren—but home nonetheless. He'd modified the cargo bay to maximize hauling capacity, upgraded the communication array to pick up subspace chatter across multiple frequencies, and installed a second bunk in the crew quarters that he never used but liked having anyway. Just in case.

The cockpit was cramped for a Lurian, but Morn had grown accustomed to folding himself into the pilot's seat, his bulk pressing against the console in ways the Yridian designers never intended. He'd worn smooth grooves in the armrests where his hands naturally fell. He'd memorized every flicker of the sensor display, every harmonic of the engine's hum.

*The Patient Ear* listened to the galaxy's secrets, and Morn listened with her.

---

The first job came through a contact on Station K-7, a Denobulan named Plix who ran a cargo brokerage from a converted storage closet. Plix had three wives, seventeen children, and an encyclopedic knowledge of who needed what moved where.

"Medical supplies," Plix said, sliding a data chip across his cluttered desk. "Colony on Vega Reticuli IV. Frontier settlement, maybe two thousand people. They've got a fever running through the population, and their regular supply ship broke down three sectors away."

Morn studied the manifest. Standard pharmaceuticals, some specialized equipment, nothing restricted. "What's the pay?"

Plix winced apologetically. "Twelve hundred credits. I know, I know—it barely covers your fuel costs. But the colony's broke, Morn. They pooled everything they had."

Twelve hundred credits for a four-day round trip. Morn did the math in his head. After fuel, maintenance reserve, and docking fees, he'd clear maybe two hundred credits. Barely enough to eat for a week.

He thought about the fever. Thought about two thousand colonists, probably families, probably children, waiting for medicine that might not come.

"I'll take it," Morn said.

Plix's face split into a genuine smile. "I knew you would. You're good people, Morn. Don't let anyone tell you different."

---

Vega Reticuli IV was a dusty world of red rock and thin atmosphere. The colony had been established fifteen years earlier by a mix of species seeking distance from the Federation's core—Bajorans fleeing the Occupation's early years, humans chasing frontier dreams, a handful of Bolians who'd found other worlds too crowded. They'd built their settlement in a crater that offered some protection from the wind, and they'd named it Hope's Landing with the earnest optimism of people who had nothing left to lose.

The fever had started three weeks ago. By the time Morn landed *The Patient Ear* on their makeshift pad, fourteen people had died.

Dr. Vess was waiting for him. She was Bajoran, middle-aged, with the kind of exhaustion that lived in the bones. Her medical coat was stained and wrinkled, and she hadn't slept in what looked like days.

"You came," she said, as if she hadn't quite believed it until this moment.

Morn lowered the cargo ramp. "Medical supplies. Everything on the manifest, plus some extra analgesics I had in my personal stores. Figured you could use them."

Dr. Vess stared at the crates, then at Morn, then back at the crates. Her eyes went bright with tears she was too tired to shed. "The Prophets sent you," she whispered.

"Just a courier," Morn said. "Doing a job."

But he helped her unload anyway, carrying crates that her exhausted staff couldn't lift. He stayed an extra six hours, helping set up the distribution system, talking with patients who were too sick to talk back. One of them, a human boy of maybe eight, grabbed Morn's hand and wouldn't let go. Morn sat with him until the medicine took effect and the fever broke.

When he finally left, Dr. Vess pressed something into his palm. A small earring, Bajoran-style, carved from local stone.

"I can't pay you more," she said. "But I can give you this. And I can tell everyone I know that Morn of *The Patient Ear* is someone who comes through."

Morn looked at the earring. Thought about the two hundred credits he'd clear from this job.

"That's enough," he said. And meant it.

---

Over the next three months, Dr. Vess proved to be the best investment Morn had ever made.

She knew people. Colonists who'd moved on to other settlements, medical officers on stations throughout the sector, administrators who needed supplies moved quickly and quietly. Word spread: Morn delivers. Morn doesn't ask for more than what's fair. Morn talks your ear off, but he shows up when he says he will.

His client list grew. Small jobs, mostly—agricultural equipment to a farming collective, personal effects for a family relocating, scientific samples for a university expedition. Nothing glamorous, nothing that would make him rich. But steady. Reliable.

For the first time since leaving Warren, Morn felt like he was building something.

---

The second job changed that.

Morn found it through a contact of a contact, a Nausicaan who went by the name Krev and operated out of a bar on Farius Prime. Krev's reputation was murky—he had connections in legitimate shipping circles, but also connections in circles that were decidedly less legitimate. People whispered that he moved cargo for the Orion Syndicate, though no one could prove it.

"Machine parts," Krev said, sliding a data chip across the bar's grimy surface. "Destination's on the chip. Don't ask about the client. Don't open the containers. Just deliver."

Morn studied the chip. The pay was listed: fifteen thousand credits. More than he'd made in the last four months combined.

"What kind of machine parts?"

Krev's expression didn't change. "The kind that go in machines."

Morn knew what that meant. Everyone in the business knew what that meant. Machine parts that couldn't be discussed, couldn't be inspected, couldn't be traced. Components that would end up inside weapons, inside ships, inside systems designed to hurt people.

He thought about saying no. Thought about walking away, keeping his conscience clean, going back to hauling agricultural equipment for two hundred credits a run.

He thought about *The Patient Ear*'s engine, which needed an overhaul he couldn't afford. Thought about the docking fees he was three weeks behind on. Thought about the meal he'd skipped yesterday because his credit balance was too low.

"I'll take it," Morn said.

The words tasted like ash.

---

The delivery point was an unnamed asteroid in an unnamed system, the kind of place that existed only on certain charts and only for certain people. Morn docked with the station carved into the rock, handed over the cargo containers, and accepted payment from a Cardassian who never gave his name.

He didn't open the containers. Didn't ask what was inside. Didn't want to know.

On the flight back, Morn sat in *The Patient Ear*'s cockpit and stared at the stars. Fifteen thousand credits sat in his account. His engine could be overhauled. His debts could be paid. He could eat regular meals for months.

He felt sick.

Who would those weapons kill? Colonists like the ones on Vega Reticuli IV? Families? Children like the boy who'd grabbed his hand?

Morn told himself he didn't know for certain they were weapons. Told himself plenty of legitimate cargo moved through unofficial channels. Told himself he was just a courier, just doing a job, just trying to survive.

The lies didn't help.

He made himself a promise that night, alone in the darkness between stars. Never again. He would find another way. He would build his legitimate business until he didn't need jobs like this one. He would be the courier who came through, not the courier who looked away.

It was a good promise. A righteous promise.

Six months later, when the credits ran low again, he broke it.

And hated himself a little more.

---

The third job came from a Ferengi named Gleb.

Morn met him on Deep Space Station Four, a trading hub where a dozen species mingled in cheerful commercial chaos. Gleb was short even for a Ferengi, with lobes that seemed too large for his head and teeth that had been filed to particularly sharp points.

"I have a cargo," Gleb announced, settling onto the bar stool next to Morn with the confidence of someone used to doing business in such places. "Delicate. Sensitive. Extremely confidential."

Morn had heard these words before. They usually preceded the kind of job he'd promised himself he wouldn't take anymore. "What kind of cargo?"

"A crate. One crate. It must be delivered to Dopteria, to a specific recipient, at a specific time. The recipient will open it—and only the recipient. You will not inspect its contents. You will not discuss its contents. You will not speculate about its contents."

"And if I ask what's inside?"

Gleb's smile revealed all of those sharp teeth. "Then I find another courier."

The pay was five thousand credits. The destination was legitimate. The secrecy was concerning.

Morn looked at Gleb, trying to read him. Ferengi were hard to read—their culture taught them to hide their intentions behind a mask of commercial enthusiasm—but Morn had known a few over the years. Gleb didn't have the desperate hunger of a Ferengi who'd bet everything on a single deal. He seemed... pleased with himself. Almost giddy.

Which was somehow more unsettling.

"I'll take it," Morn said.

He hoped he wouldn't regret it.

---

The crate was a meter on each side, made of reinforced duranium with a lock keyed to a specific biosignature. Morn loaded it into his cargo bay and tried not to think about what might be inside.

On the first day of the trip, he convinced himself it was contraband. Stolen goods, maybe. Rare artifacts being smuggled off-world.

On the second day, darker possibilities crept in. A weapon. A biological agent. Something that would hurt people, that he would be responsible for delivering.

On the third day, he barely slept. Every sound *The Patient Ear* made—every creak of the hull, every fluctuation in the engine's hum—seemed like a warning. He checked the cargo bay six times, scanning the crate with every sensor he had. Nothing penetrated its shell. Its contents remained a mystery.

By the time he reached Dopteria, Morn was a wreck. His hands shook on the controls. His stomach had tied itself into knots.

The recipient was a Dopterian female named Talla, who met him at the delivery coordinates with a smile that seemed too cheerful for someone receiving mysterious contraband. She was young, maybe the Dopterian equivalent of thirty, and she practically bounced on her heels as Morn unloaded the crate.

"Oh, finally!" she exclaimed. "I've been waiting weeks for this!"

Morn stepped back, putting distance between himself and whatever was about to emerge. "You need to sign for—"

Talla pressed her palm to the lock. It clicked open.

Morn held his breath.

Inside the crate, nestled in protective padding, was a stuffed animal. A targ, to be specific—the Klingon variety, with purple fur and tiny felt tusks. Next to it was a card that read, in elaborate script: "Happy Birthday to my favorite niece!"

Morn stared.

Talla lifted the stuffed targ, her face splitting into a delighted grin. "Uncle Gleb remembered! He actually remembered!" She hugged the toy to her chest. "He's terrible at gifts, you know. Last year he sent me a promissory note. But this—this is perfect!"

Morn continued to stare.

Three days of terror. Three days of imagining weapons and bioweapons and crimes against sapient beings. Three days of questioning his choices, his career, his entire existence.

For a stuffed targ.

He started to laugh.

It began as a chuckle, but quickly escalated. Within moments, Morn was doubled over, clutching his midsection, tears streaming down his face. He laughed until he couldn't breathe, until his sides ached, until Talla started backing away with a concerned expression.

"Are you... are you all right?" she asked.

Morn wiped his eyes. Tried to speak. Failed. Laughed some more.

He laughed for the better part of an hour, sitting on a cargo crate on Dopteria while Talla's neighbors peered out their windows and wondered what was wrong with the Lurian. Every time he thought he had himself under control, he'd look at the stuffed targ and start again.

When he finally returned to *The Patient Ear*, his stomach muscles ached and his throat was raw.

It was the best he'd felt in years.

---

Six months after the stuffed targ incident, Morn's reputation had solidified into something valuable.

"Morn talks, Morn listens, Morn doesn't repeat." That was how Plix described him to potential clients. "You want someone who'll deliver on time and keep his mouth shut about what he's delivering? Morn's your man."

It was strange, Morn reflected, how his greatest assets had emerged from his greatest fears. He talked constantly because silence reminded him of the years he'd spent mute. He listened carefully because understanding others was the only way he'd survived. He kept secrets because he knew what it was like to have secrets of his own.

The combination made him valuable in ways he hadn't anticipated.

He still took gray jobs occasionally—he wasn't proud of it, but he wasn't naive enough to think he could survive on legitimate cargo alone. But he'd developed rules. Nothing that was obviously weapons. Nothing that seemed designed to hurt civilians. Nothing that made him lie awake at night, wondering about the consequences of his choices.

It wasn't perfect. It wasn't even particularly moral. But it was his, and he could live with it.

Most days.

---

The message arrived on a Tuesday.

Morn was docked at Station K-7, negotiating with Plix about a cargo run to the Rigel system, when his comm unit chirped with an incoming transmission. He almost ignored it—Plix was in the middle of a complicated anecdote about his second wife's cousin's business partner—but something made him glance at the sender ID.

Unknown origin. Encrypted channel. Priority routing.

Someone had spent considerable resources getting this message to him.

"Hold that thought," Morn said to Plix, and stepped into the corridor to read.

The message was brief:

*Morn of The Patient Ear—*

*Your reputation precedes you. I have a business proposition that requires someone with your particular combination of skills. The work is unconventional but lucrative. More importantly, it offers something I suspect you've been missing: belonging.*

*I'll be at the Celestial Café on Risa in three weeks. Join me for a drink. Let's talk about the future.*

*— Hain*

Morn read the message twice. Three times.

He didn't know anyone named Hain. Had never heard the name in any of his networks. Whoever this was, they'd researched him thoroughly enough to know exactly which buttons to push.

Belonging. Such a small word. Such an enormous weight.

Morn thought about the lonely years since leaving Warren. Thought about the empty bunk in his crew quarters, the silence that filled *The Patient Ear* when he wasn't talking to himself. Thought about how tired he was of being alone.

It was probably nothing. Probably a scam, or a trap, or a job that would compromise whatever remained of his principles.

But Risa was beautiful this time of year.

And he could always say no.

Morn drafted his reply, keeping it as brief as the original message:

*I'll be there.*

*— Morn*

He sent it before he could change his mind.
