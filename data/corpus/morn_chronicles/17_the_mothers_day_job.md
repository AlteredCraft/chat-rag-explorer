# Chapter 17: The Mother's Day Job

The Central Bank of Lissepia rose from the plaza like a monument to institutional confidence. Columns of polished darkstone. Doors of hammered bronze depicting the Five Founding Mothers. Windows narrow as knife wounds, positioned too high to breach.

Morn had walked past it eleven times in the past three weeks. He knew every guard rotation, every delivery schedule, every architectural flaw invisible to the untrained eye.

Today, for the first time, he would walk through those bronze doors.

"Everyone in position?" Hain's voice crackled through the subcutaneous comm unit nestled behind Morn's right ear. The device was Yridian—undetectable by standard security sweeps.

"Construction site, ready." Krit's voice. Calm. Professional.

"Same." Nahsk, beside him.

"Couple approaching main entrance." Larell's arm tightened around Morn's. She wore the flowing ceremonial dress of a Lissepian matriarch—borrowed, forged documents establishing her as a minor merchant's daughter from the southern provinces. The dress was the color of sunrise, traditional for Mother's Day.

Morn wore his discomfort like a second skin.

"Go," Hain said.

---

The lobby smelled of incense and floor polish. Portraits of bank founders—all female, as Lissepian tradition demanded—gazed down from gilded frames. A skeleton crew staffed the counters: three tellers, two managers, a single security guard by the inner doors.

Mother's Day. The holiest day on the Lissepian calendar. Families gathered. Businesses closed. Banks operated with minimal staff for emergencies only.

Larell had chosen this day six months ago.

"Welcome to the Central Bank." The teller's smile was perfunctory, her eyes already calculating how quickly she could process these tourists and return to her holiday reverie. "How may I assist you?"

"We want to open an account!" Morn announced, his voice carrying across the marble lobby. Several heads turned. The security guard's eyes flicked toward them, assessed, dismissed. "My beloved and I are relocating to the capital, and everyone says—everyone, truly, you should hear how many people recommended you—that the Central Bank offers the finest investment services on the planet. We're thinking bonds. Or perhaps certificates. Do you still offer the maternal heritage certificates? My mother—rest her memory—always said those were—"

"Sir." The teller held up a hand. "Please. Lower your voice."

"Of course, of course." Morn didn't lower his voice. "I apologize. I'm simply so excited. New city, new life, new opportunities. Did you know we traveled seventeen days to reach the capital? Seventeen! The transport system in the outer provinces is absolutely—"

Larell squeezed his arm. "Darling, let the nice woman speak."

"Yes, yes. Forgive me. I talk when I'm nervous. Everyone says so. 'Morn,' they say, 'you could talk the spots off a Trelian sand-cat.' Not that I've ever seen a sand-cat, mind you, but I understand they're quite—"

"*Sir.*"

---

Across the street, in a rented room above a fabric shop, Hain watched through a scope designed for orbital surveillance. At this magnification, he could count the beads of sweat on the teller's forehead.

"He's good," Hain murmured. "Krit, status?"

"Junction box accessed. Nahsk is running the bypass."

"How long?"

"Ninety seconds. Maybe less."

Hain watched Morn gesture expansively, nearly knocking over a decorative plant. The teller's expression cycled through irritation, resignation, and something approaching pity.

Perfect.

---

The inner security guard had migrated closer to the front desk. Curiosity or concern—it didn't matter. His attention was no longer on the corridor behind him.

Larell caught Morn's eye. The slightest nod.

"—and that's when my aunt said, 'The secret to a happy marriage is separate accounts!' Can you imagine? Separate accounts! But I told her, I said, 'Aunt Vella, my darling and I share everything. *Everything*.'"

Larell pressed a hand to her stomach. Her face shifted—a subtle masterwork of microexpressions that turned comfort to distress in the space of a heartbeat.

"Oh," she breathed. "Oh, I don't feel—"

She swayed. The teller lunged forward instinctively. The manager emerged from her office. The security guard took three steps toward the commotion.

Morn caught Larell as she collapsed, his body positioned to block any view of the corridor.

"Water!" he shouted. "Someone bring water! She's carrying our first child—the excitement must have overwhelmed her—please, is there somewhere she can lie down?"

The manager was already gesturing toward a side office. The guard helped support Larell's other arm. The teller rushed for water.

No one watched Morn's feet shuffle two steps backward.

Then three.

Then he was around the corner, invisible, moving.

---

"Security grid is down," Nahsk reported. "Sixty-second window."

"Morn, you're clear," Hain said. "Vault corridor, left at the second junction. Door code is 7-7-4-2-Mother."

Morn moved. His hearts hammered against his ribs. The first heartbeat—his primary—pumped terror through his system. The second—vestigial in most Lurians, enlarged in Morn—pumped something colder. Focus. Purpose.

The weight in his stomach shifted with each step. Thirty-seven liters of liquid latinum, extracted drop by drop over nineteen days, stored in the secondary digestive sac that evolution had given his species for lean times. It made him feel bloated. Nauseous. Incredibly, impossibly wealthy.

Left at the second junction.

The vault door loomed. Tritanium-alloy, six inches thick, equipped with biometric scanners and a twelve-digit rotating cipher.

All bypassed. All dark. Sixty seconds.

Morn entered the code. The door sighed open on hydraulic hinges.

---

"Status?" Hain's voice was ice.

"I'm in."

---

The vault stretched before him. Climate-controlled. Humidity-regulated. Rows of deposit boxes lined the walls, but Morn's eyes went immediately to the center of the room.

The pallet.

One thousand bricks of gold-pressed latinum, stacked in precise rows of ten by ten by ten. Each brick worth a small fortune. Together, they represented enough wealth to purchase a starship. A small moon. A government or two, in the right system.

Morn stood before them and felt nothing.

No—that wasn't true. He felt the weight in his stomach. The liquid latinum already inside him, waiting. He felt the ghost of every extraction, every careful hour spent with improvised equipment, siphoning the real wealth from worthless golden shells.

He felt like a thief.

Because that's what he was.

Forty-two seconds.

The replacement shells were hidden in a maintenance panel Larell had identified three weeks ago. Morn retrieved them now—a thousand empty bricks, identical in appearance to the originals, hollow as his conscience.

He began the swap. One brick lifted, one brick placed. The originals went into the maintenance panel. The fakes took their place on the pallet.

His hands didn't shake. He'd practiced this motion ten thousand times. He could do it in his sleep. He'd done it in his sleep, nightmares of fumbled bricks and screaming alarms.

Thirty seconds.

Stack by stack. Row by row. The pallet transformed, though no observer would notice the difference. Gold-pressed latinum looked exactly like worthless gold-pressed nothing. Only a molecular scanner could tell them apart.

The Central Bank performed molecular scans once per quarter.

Fifteen seconds.

The last brick settled into place.

Morn sealed the maintenance panel. He took one breath. Two.

Then he walked out of the vault, closed the door behind him, and listened to the locks re-engage.

---

"He's out," Hain reported. "Krit, restore the grid."

"Restoring."

The security systems hummed back to life. Cameras resumed their sweeps. Motion sensors reactivated. Everything exactly as it had been.

Everything entirely different.

---

Larell's recovery was miraculous. Color returned to her cheeks. Strength flooded her limbs. She apologized profusely—the pregnancy, the travel, the excitement of opening their first joint account.

The manager was sympathetic. The teller was relieved. The security guard helped Larell to a chair and accepted her tearful gratitude with awkward grace.

"Perhaps we should return another day," Morn said, reappearing from the direction of the refreshment area with a cup of water no one had asked for. "When my darling is feeling stronger."

"Yes," Larell agreed weakly. "Another day."

They departed arm in arm, expressions of profound disappointment masking profound triumph.

The bronze doors closed behind them.

---

Hain waited four minutes after Morn and Larell disappeared around the corner before packing his equipment. The scope collapsed into a tube the size of his forearm. The monitoring station folded into a case that resembled merchant's luggage.

He descended the stairs, nodded to the fabric shop owner, and stepped into the afternoon sun.

Across the plaza, the Central Bank stood unchanged. Serene. Confident.

Robbed.

---

Krit and Nahsk shed their construction uniforms in the back of a rented ground vehicle. Beneath, they wore the casual clothes of tourists—unremarkable, unmemorable. They joined the Mother's Day crowds, bought sweet-cakes from a street vendor, laughed at jokes neither of them heard.

They walked for twenty minutes before doubling back.

Then doubling back again.

Then, finally, approaching the safehouse from the west.

---

Morn reached the safehouse first. His legs had carried him there automatically, muscle memory and adrenaline guiding his steps while his mind remained trapped in the vault.

*I did it.*

*We did it.*

*I'm a thief.*

The safehouse was a converted storage unit in the industrial district—rented under a false name, furnished with the bare minimum, scheduled for abandonment in six hours. Morn stood in the center of the empty room and waited for his hearts to slow.

They didn't.

---

Larell arrived next, the ceremonial dress exchanged for practical traveling clothes. Her face was flushed, her eyes bright.

"That was *exquisite*," she breathed. "Did you see the guard? He practically carried me to the office. I thought he was going to propose."

Morn tried to smile. His face didn't cooperate.

"You were perfect," Larell continued, crossing to him, taking his hands. "The talking. The bumbling. They never suspected for a moment."

"No," Morn agreed. "They didn't."

---

Krit and Nahsk arrived together, their earlier tension dissolved in the alchemy of shared success. Krit was grinning—an expression that transformed his weathered face into something almost boyish. Nahsk's shoulders had lost their perpetual hunch.

"Clean exit," Krit reported. "No tails. No alerts on the emergency frequencies."

"The bypass worked perfectly," Nahsk added. "Sixty seconds exactly. In and out like it never happened."

"Because it didn't happen." Hain's voice came from the doorway. He entered the safehouse last, equipment cases in hand, expression unreadable. "Not officially. Not for at least another three months, when they run their quarterly inventory."

The door closed behind him.

For a moment, no one spoke.

Then Larell laughed—a bright, brittle sound that shattered the silence. Krit joined her. Nahsk. Even Hain's lips curved upward.

Morn stood in the center of their celebration and felt the latinum shift in his stomach. Thirty-seven liters. One thousand bricks' worth. A fortune beyond counting.

*I did this.*

*I can never undo this.*

---

Hain produced a bottle from his case—Andorian ale, the real stuff, smuggled at considerable expense. Five glasses appeared. Five measures poured.

"To the plan," Larell said, raising her glass.

"To the execution," Krit added.

"To the team," Nahsk offered.

Hain studied his glass for a long moment. Then he raised it, his eyes meeting Morn's across the room.

"To Mother's Day," he said.

They drank.

The ale burned going down. Morn welcomed the sensation—something to feel besides the weight in his stomach, the hollow in his chest.

Around him, his crew celebrated. They'd done the impossible. They'd robbed the Central Bank of Lissepia without firing a shot, without raising an alarm, without leaving a trace. The perfect crime.

Morn excused himself. Found the refresher. Locked the door.

He stood over the basin and stared at his reflection. Same face. Same eyes. Same Morn who'd arrived on Lissepia eight weeks ago with nothing but questions and hope.

Different man.

The nausea rolled through him—partly the latinum, partly the ale, mostly something else entirely. He gripped the basin's edge and breathed.

*I'm a thief.*

*I'm a criminal.*

*I'm rich beyond measure, and I've never felt so poor.*

A knock on the door. "Morn?" Larell's voice. "Everything all right?"

He straightened. Composed his expression. Found the genial mask that had served him so well today.

"Fine," he called back. "Just the excitement. Give me a moment."

He took that moment. And another. And one more.

Then he opened the door, rejoined his crew, and raised his glass for another toast.

*To Mother's Day.*

*To what we've done.*

*To what we've become.*
