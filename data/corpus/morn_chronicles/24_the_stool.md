# Chapter 24: The Stool

The stool was nothing special. Standard Cardassian manufacture, repurposed from a mining station's mess hall, its surface worn smooth by countless occupants over the years. The seat had a slight depression in the center where generations of tired workers had rested their weight. One of the three legs was fractionally shorter than the others, creating an almost imperceptible wobble that Morn had learned to compensate for by shifting his bulk slightly to the left.

It was the third stool from the end of the bar, positioned perfectly. Close enough to the main floor to observe the dabo tables and the flow of traffic, far enough from the entrance to avoid the cold drafts that swept in whenever someone opened the airlock doors on the Promenade. The lighting was good here—not so bright as to be harsh, not so dim as to strain his eyes during the long hours of watching.

Morn had tried other stools in the early days. The one at the far end offered more privacy but had a restricted sightline to the upper level. The two nearest the entrance saw too much foot traffic, too many jostling elbows from newcomers who hadn't learned to navigate the bar's crowded spaces. The middle section put him too close to the Ferengi staff's service corridor, where the constant back-and-forth interrupted his contemplation.

But the third stool from the end. That was the one.

He arrived each morning at the same time, when the station's artificial lighting shifted from its night-cycle amber to the cooler tones meant to simulate a planetary dawn. Quark was always already there, polishing glasses or reviewing the previous night's receipts with the particular intensity of someone who believed every missed decimal point was a personal affront from the universe.

"The usual?" Quark would ask, though they both knew he would bring it without waiting for an answer.

Morn would settle onto his stool, feeling the familiar wobble, the familiar depression, the familiar angle of light from the fixtures above. He would wrap his large hands around whatever Quark brought him—it varied, Quark liked to experiment with his regular customers—and he would begin his vigil.

---

The bar filled gradually as the morning progressed. First came the night-shift workers ending their rotations, looking for a drink before sleep. Then the early risers, the ones who needed something to steady their nerves before facing the station's perpetual chaos. By midday, the place hummed with its full complement of travelers, traders, Starfleet personnel, and locals.

Morn watched them all.

He had developed, over his months as a fixture of Quark's establishment, a taxonomy of the bar's visitors. There were the Transients—passengers waiting for transport connections, their luggage piled at their feet, their eyes constantly darting to the departure boards visible through the bar's entrance. They were easy to identify by their restlessness, their inability to settle into the rhythm of the place.

Then there were the Regulars, like himself. Not many of them yet—the station was still establishing its identity after the Cardassian withdrawal—but a few had begun to crystallize out of the constant flow of newcomers. There was a Bolian freighter captain who appeared every third week, always taking the same corner booth, always ordering the same imported ale from his homeworld. A group of Bajoran maintenance workers who gathered each evening after their shifts, their conversations a mixture of complaints about the Cardassian-designed systems they had to maintain and tentative optimism about the future.

And there were the Staff—not Quark's employees, but the station's personnel who had begun treating the bar as an extension of their workplace. Starfleet officers in their color-coded uniforms, Bajoran militia in their earth-toned fatigues, civilian administrators in whatever they happened to be wearing. They came to unwind, to gossip, to conduct the unofficial business that couldn't happen in briefing rooms.

Morn observed them all, cataloging their habits, their relationships, their small dramas and large ambitions. He said nothing. He didn't need to.

"Who's the Lurian?"

The question came from a newly arrived ensign, her gold uniform still crisp and unworn, her eyes taking in the bar with the mixture of excitement and wariness common to fresh Starfleet postings on the frontier.

Quark glanced over at Morn without pausing in his pour. "That's Morn. He's always here."

The ensign waited for more information. When none came, she pressed: "But what does he do?"

Quark shrugged. "He sits. He drinks. He observes." The Ferengi slid the completed drink across the bar to another customer. "Some people come to my establishment for entertainment. Some for business. Morn comes for the ambiance."

"That's it?"

"What more is there?" Quark's ears twitched—the Ferengi equivalent of a knowing smile. "Not everyone needs to be going somewhere, ensign. Some people have already arrived."

Morn heard the exchange, as he heard most of what transpired within the bar's confines. He didn't react. He had become accustomed to being explained, to being part of the scenery that Quark used to establish the character of his establishment. The mysterious Lurian at the bar, perpetually present, perpetually silent—it added to the atmosphere.

The ensign studied him for a moment longer, then shrugged and turned her attention elsewhere. Within a week, Morn knew, she would stop noticing him at all. He would become invisible, part of the furniture.

That was exactly what he wanted.

---

A Bajoran lieutenant sat down beside him late one afternoon, his face carrying the particular expression of someone whose world had recently collapsed.

"Mind if I sit here?" the man asked, though he was already sitting.

Morn gestured vaguely—a wave of permission that could have meant anything or nothing.

The lieutenant ordered something strong, consumed it rapidly, ordered another. His hands trembled slightly as he raised the glass. Morn had seen this pattern before. The second drink went down more slowly, giving the man time to organize whatever words were building pressure inside him.

"She left me," the lieutenant finally said, staring at the bar's surface as if the answer to his pain might be hidden in its polished wood. "Three years together, and she just... left. Said she couldn't compete with my devotion to service." He laughed bitterly. "Devotion to service. I'm a quartermaster. I spend my days counting cargo containers and filing requisition forms."

Morn listened. That was what he did now. He had developed, without intending to, a reputation as someone safe to confide in. Perhaps it was his silence—people trusted those who didn't interrupt, didn't judge, didn't share their secrets with others. Perhaps it was his size—something about his bulk suggested stability, permanence. Perhaps it was simply that he was always there, always available, a constant in the station's ever-shifting population.

The lieutenant talked for nearly an hour. About the relationship's beginning, its middle happiness, its slow deterioration. About his fears of being alone. About the cold quarters waiting for him at the end of his shift.

Morn nodded at appropriate moments. He grunted in sympathy when sympathy was called for. He said nothing of substance, but his presence was enough. When the lieutenant finally left, he clapped Morn on the shoulder with a familiarity that would have seemed presumptuous a few hours earlier.

"Thanks for listening," he said. "I needed that."

Morn watched him go, wondering if the man would remember their conversation tomorrow, or if it would fade into the general blur of a painful period eventually overcome. It didn't matter. The listening had served its purpose.

---

Late at night, when the crowds had thinned and only the truly dedicated drinkers remained, Morn's thoughts often turned inward.

He tried to calculate how long it had been since he'd contacted his family on Luria. Decades, certainly. The last message he'd sent had been shortly after the heist, a carefully worded note assuring them he was alive and well but engaged in business that required discretion. He hadn't mentioned where he was going, what he was doing, or when he might return.

That had been... sixty years ago? Seventy?

His mother would be elderly now, if she was still alive. Lurians were long-lived, but not immortal. His siblings would have married, had children, perhaps grandchildren. The family shipping business would have changed hands, adapted to new markets, perhaps expanded or contracted depending on the sector's economic fluctuations.

They might think he was dead. It was a reasonable assumption. A Lurian who disappears for seventy years, whose last communication was a cryptic message about discretion—what else would they think?

Part of him wanted to reach out. To send a message, however brief, letting them know he still existed. To see a familiar face on a viewscreen, to hear the particular cadence of his mother's voice, to learn what had become of everyone he had left behind.

But the heist crew might still be watching.

He shifted on his stool, feeling the familiar weight in his kelvu—the latinum he had swallowed so long ago it had become simply part of his body's geography. The gold-pressed bars had never triggered any transporter biofilters or scanner sweeps. They were his secret, his burden, his insurance against a future that might still turn hostile.

If Nahsk or the twins were monitoring communications from Luria, any message he sent could lead them directly to him. And while years had passed, Morn knew better than most that some grudges transcended time. The latinum he carried was worth killing for. It had always been worth killing for.

So he remained silent. The family he had left behind remained unknowing. And the distance between them grew wider with each passing year.

The bar after closing was a different place.

The noise and chaos of the day gave way to stillness. The lighting dimmed to a comfortable amber. The glasses stood empty in their racks, waiting to be filled again. The dabo tables were silent, their wheels motionless.

Quark worked at the till, his fingers dancing over the interface as he reconciled the day's receipts. He muttered occasionally—small curses when the numbers didn't align, small sounds of satisfaction when they did. It was a nightly ritual, as reliable as the station's maintenance cycles.

Morn sat at his stool, nursing the last drink Quark had poured before beginning his accounting. He didn't need to be here. His quarters on the habitat ring were comfortable enough, and sleep would claim him eventually whether he sought it or not. But there was something about these quiet hours that he had come to treasure.

For one hundred and fifty-eight years, he had been in motion. Traveling between systems, running from disasters, chasing opportunities, fleeing consequences. Even when he stopped to rest, part of him had always been calculating the next move, the next destination, the next chapter in a life defined by constant change.

But here, in Quark's bar on Deep Space 9, the calculation had finally stopped.

He wasn't going anywhere. There was nowhere else he needed to be. The stool beneath him, worn and wobbling and perfectly positioned—this was his place in the universe. Not a waypoint, not a temporary refuge, but a destination.

Quark finished his counting and closed the till with a satisfied click. He glanced over at Morn, still sitting, still present, still silent.

Neither of them spoke. They didn't need to.

The Ferengi began wiping down the bar, working his way methodically from one end to the other. When he reached Morn's section, he worked around the Lurian without asking him to move, without comment, without acknowledgment. It was simply the routine they had established—two solitary beings sharing a space, requiring nothing from each other but presence.

The weight in Morn's kelvu pressed against his insides, constant and familiar. The secret he carried, the fortune that had cost him everything and nothing, had become simply another part of his body. He barely noticed it anymore.

Outside, the Promenade was quiet. The station hummed with the perpetual systems that kept its inhabitants alive and comfortable. Somewhere in the depths of the habitat ring, the Bajoran lieutenant was sleeping, perhaps dreaming of better days. Somewhere in the docking bay, the Bolian freighter captain was preparing for departure. Somewhere on Luria, a family wondered about a son and brother who had vanished seventy years ago.

But Morn was here. Present. At rest.

After a lifetime of wandering, he had found his place.

It was a barstool. And that was enough.
