# Chapter 5: The Trade Tongue

The trading hall of the Galorum Warren smelled of dried kelp and old data pads. Morn sat at one of the long stone tables, his still-tender post-molt skin itching against the woven seat cushion. Across from him, his eldest sister Kellura arranged a series of cargo manifests with the precision of a military strategist planning an invasion.

"The Trade Tongue," Kellura began, her voice carrying the weight of generations of Galorum merchants, "is the foundation of all interspecies commerce. It is efficient. It is clear. It is the opposite of everything you have ever said in your entire life."

Morn opened his mouth to respond.

"That was not an invitation to demonstrate," Kellura said.

She was forty-seven years old and had negotiated deals across half the quadrant. Her kelvu ridges had darkened to a deep bronze with experience, and her eyes held the particular intensity of someone who had once talked a Ferengi into a fair price. The family still spoke of that achievement in reverent whispers.

"Now," Kellura continued, tapping the first manifest. "Basic transaction. Repeat after me: 'Cargo ready. Price set. Payment accepted.'"

"Cargo ready," Morn said carefully. "Price set. Payment accepted."

"Good. Now, a negotiation opener: 'Terms flexible. Quantity variable. Discuss.'"

"Terms flexible. Quantity variable. Discuss."

Kellura nodded, something like hope flickering in her expression. "Perhaps this won't be as difficult as I feared. Now, let's practice a full exchange. I am a Bolian textile merchant. You are selling me three containers of processed mineral salts. Begin."

Morn straightened in his seat. This was his moment. He had watched traders come and go from the Warren his entire life. He had listened to negotiations from behind cargo crates and through ventilation grates. He knew how this worked.

"Greetings, honored merchant," he began. "I am Morn of the Galorum Shipping Clan, and I am delighted to make your acquaintance on this fine day. The morning light over the eastern salt flats was particularly beautiful as I made my way here, which reminds me of a story my brother Durvo once told me about the time he—"

"Stop." Kellura held up one hand. "Stop, stop, stop."

"I was just establishing rapport—"

"You were establishing that I would be here until the next tide cycle." She pressed her fingers to her temples. "Morn. The Trade Tongue exists because different species have different languages, different customs, different attention spans. A Tellarite wants to argue. A Vulcan wants logic. A human wants to feel clever. The Trade Tongue cuts through all of that. It is neutral ground. It is *brief*."

"But don't you think—"

"Briefly. State your response briefly."

Morn considered this. "I understand."

"Two words. Beautiful. Hold onto that feeling." Kellura slid a data pad across the table. "This is the standard Trade Tongue lexicon. Four hundred and twelve words. Every concept a merchant needs. Learn them."

Morn looked at the list. The words sat there, stark and lonely. *Buy. Sell. Price. Quality. Ship. Cargo. Accept. Reject. Terms.* They seemed so cold, so truncated. How was anyone supposed to convey the rich complexity of a business relationship with just four hundred and twelve words?

"Where's the word for 'the way the light catches the edge of a cargo container at sunset'?" he asked.

Kellura stared at him for a long moment. "There isn't one."

"That seems like an oversight."

"It seems like efficiency." She stood, moving to the window that overlooked the Warren's central courtyard. Below, Morn could see cousins and aunts loading cargo onto transport skimmers. "Do you know why the Galorum fleet has survived for twelve generations?"

"Because we're excellent pilots?"

"Because we deliver on time, at agreed prices, with no complications. Our word is our bond. When a Galorum says 'cargo secure, delivery guaranteed,' other species know exactly what that means. No ambiguity. No confusion. No stories about Durvo and the salt flats."

"It was actually a very funny story—"

"I'm sure it was. It's also irrelevant to commerce." Kellura turned back to face him. "You are seventeen. You have passed your First Molt. You are officially an adult member of this clan. That means you will learn to trade, Morn. Every Galorum learns to trade."

"I want to learn," Morn said, and he meant it. He had always been fascinated by the merchants who visited the Warren—the strange ships, the unusual cargoes, the stories they carried from distant worlds. "I just think there might be more to trading than the Trade Tongue."

"There is. There's mathematics. There's logistics. There's contract law." Kellura allowed herself a small smile. "And there's reading people. Which, despite your apparent inability to stop talking, you are surprisingly good at."

Morn blinked. "I am?"

"You always know when someone is sad, or angry, or hiding something. You notice things." She returned to her seat. "Unfortunately, you then talk about those things for approximately three hours, which somewhat diminishes the tactical advantage."

"I don't talk for three hours."

Kellura raised one eyebrow ridge.

"Two hours, perhaps," Morn amended. "Two and a half at most."

The off-world merchants arrived three days later, their shuttle settling onto the Warren's landing pad with a hiss of atmospheric venting. Morn watched from the trading hall window as two figures emerged—a Rigellian with elaborate facial tattoos and a human woman with close-cropped gray hair and the weathered look of someone who had spent decades in space.

"The Rigellian is Captain Voss," Kellura said, appearing at his shoulder. "She runs cargo between here and the Rigel colonies. The human is her business partner, Delacroix. They're here for three containers of medical-grade mineral compounds. This is a standard transaction—the price was negotiated months ago. All you need to do is confirm the cargo, accept payment, and provide the loading codes."

"That's all?"

"That's all. You can manage that, can't you?"

Morn nodded eagerly. His first real transaction. His first step into the family business. He would make Kellura proud. He would be brief. He would be efficient. He would embody the Trade Tongue in all its stark, beautiful simplicity.

"Cargo ready," he practiced under his breath as the merchants entered the hall. "Price set. Payment accepted."

Captain Voss approached with the long stride of someone accustomed to artificial gravity. Delacroix hung back slightly, data pad in hand, clearly the record-keeper of the pair.

"Galorum Clan?" Voss said. Her Trade Tongue was crisp and practiced.

"Cargo ready," Morn replied. "Price set. Payment—"

"You're young," Voss interrupted, tilting her head. "New to this?"

And that was where everything went sideways.

Because Morn could have simply said "Yes." One word. Clean. Efficient. Exactly what the Trade Tongue required.

Instead, he found himself saying, "I just completed my First Molt two years ago, which was an interesting experience—have you ever shed your entire outer layer of skin? Probably not, humans don't do that, do they? Anyway, I chose to keep my name, which some people found surprising, but I've always liked 'Morn.' It has a pleasant sound. The morning, you know? New beginnings. My mother named me after the morning light on the salt flats, which is actually quite beautiful if you've never seen it. The way it catches the crystalline structures—"

Kellura made a sound somewhere between a sigh and a groan.

"—creates these prismatic effects that my brother Durvo once tried to capture in a painting. He's not very good at painting, to be honest, but he's enthusiastic, which I think counts for something. Do you paint, Captain Voss? Or you, Ms. Delacroix? I've heard humans are quite artistic as a species—"

"We don't paint," Delacroix said, but there was something strange in her voice. Amusement, perhaps.

"Ah, well, not everyone does. My father never painted either. He was more interested in navigation. Did you know the Galorum fleet has been operating for twelve generations? Twelve! That's a lot of cargo runs. My great-great-great—I'm not sure how many greats—grandmother Thessaly founded the fleet with just a single ship. A converted mining vessel, actually. Quite cramped, from what I understand, but she made it work. She had a philosophy about trade that I find quite compelling—"

"Does he stop?" Voss asked Kellura.

"Not in my experience," Kellura said flatly.

"—she believed that every transaction was a relationship, not just an exchange. You're not just moving cargo, you're building trust. Which is why the Galorum word for 'contract' shares a root with our word for 'promise.' Isn't that interesting? Language tells you so much about culture. For example, I've heard that Rigellian has seventeen different words for 'debt,' each with subtle implications about—"

"We'll take the cargo," Voss said suddenly.

Morn paused. "But I haven't quoted the price yet."

"I don't care." Voss reached into her jacket and produced a credit chip. "Here. Whatever the agreed amount was, add ten percent. Consider it a... consideration."

Delacroix leaned over to whisper to Voss, "That's an extra fifteen hundred credits."

"I'm aware."

"Just to make him stop talking?"

"Worth every chip."

Morn accepted the payment, slightly confused. "Don't you want to inspect the cargo first? I could give you a tour of our storage facilities. They're quite impressive—temperature-controlled, humidity-regulated, and my uncle Neros designed the automated inventory system himself after a fascinating trip to—"

"Loading codes," Voss said firmly. "Just the loading codes."

Morn transmitted the codes to Delacroix's data pad. The transaction was complete. The merchants headed for the door with more haste than seemed entirely necessary.

"It was lovely meeting you!" Morn called after them. "Safe travels! If you're ever in the sector again, I'd love to hear more about Rigellian trade customs! I have questions about those seventeen words for debt—"

The door closed behind them.

Morn turned to Kellura, beaming. "I think that went well."

His sister stared at him. Her expression cycled through several emotions—disbelief, frustration, and something that might have been reluctant admiration.

"They overpaid," she said slowly. "By ten percent."

"Yes, wasn't that generous?"

"It wasn't generous. They paid you to stop talking."

Morn considered this. "Well, either way, we made an extra fifteen hundred credits."

Kellura opened her mouth, then closed it. She walked to the window and watched the merchants' shuttle lift off, banking hard toward orbit as if fleeing a natural disaster.

"That is not how the Trade Tongue works," she finally said.

"No," Morn agreed cheerfully. "But it worked."

For a long moment, Kellura was silent. Morn had known his sister his entire life, had watched her negotiate deals that seemed impossible, had seen her command respect from merchants across the quadrant. He had never seen her look quite so thoroughly at a loss.

"There may be," she said slowly, as if the words were being pulled from her against her will, "more than one way to trade."

Morn's smile widened. "Really?"

"Don't let it go to your head." Kellura gathered her data pads, her composure reassembling itself. "Tomorrow we're going over contract law. Four hours. No stories about Durvo."

"What if the stories are relevant to contract law?"

"They won't be."

"You'd be surprised. There was this one time he entered into a verbal agreement with a kelp farmer—"

"Morn."

"Yes?"

"Go celebrate your first successful transaction. Somewhere else. Quietly." She paused. "If that's possible."

Morn practically bounced out of the trading hall, his kelvu ridges warm with pride. He had made his first sale. He had made extra profit. And he had done it his way—not with the stark efficiency of the Trade Tongue, but with something that felt more natural, more *him*.

Maybe his words weren't weapons of precision like Kellura's. Maybe they were more like a flood, overwhelming but oddly effective. Either way, they were his.

The evening light was golden over the Warren as he walked, and for once, Morn didn't feel the need to describe it to anyone. He just let it wash over him, warm and promising, full of possibility.

Somewhere in the galaxy, there were beings who would pay extra just to hear him talk.

That had to count for something.
