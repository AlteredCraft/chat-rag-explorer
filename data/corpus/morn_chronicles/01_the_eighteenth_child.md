# Chapter 1: The Eighteenth Child

The screaming had stopped, which meant it was almost over.

Drennik pressed his face against the carved stone railing of the upper gallery, his thick fingers gripping the cool mineral surface as he strained to see the door to the birthing chamber below. The great common hall of Galorum Warren was packed with bodies—aunts and uncles and cousins and siblings, all waiting, all watching that same door.

"Move over," Verrik demanded, shoving at Drennik's shoulder with the clumsy insistence of a one-year-old who had only recently mastered walking.

"No. I was here first."

"But I can't *see*."

Drennik considered this. Verrik was small and annoying and had been the baby of the family for an entire year, which meant everyone had fussed over him constantly while Drennik had been expected to suddenly become responsible. The injustice of it still burned in his gorvu like undigested grain.

But today, everything changed.

"Fine." Drennik shuffled sideways, making room. "But you have to be quiet. This is important."

"Why?"

"Because after today, there's going to be someone younger than both of us. Someone we get to boss around."

Verrik's eyes—still holding the cloudiness of infancy—widened with understanding. "Oh."

"Exactly."

Below them, the door to the birthing chamber remained closed. The Warren's healers had been in there for six hours now, which Prenna had said was actually quite fast for an eighteenth child. Drennik didn't understand how that worked—surely the more babies you had, the better you got at it?—but he'd learned not to question Prenna about healing matters. She always gave answers that made his head hurt.

The common hall hummed with conversation, the deep resonant tones of Lurian voices creating a kind of music that Drennik associated with home, with safety, with belonging. The hall itself was massive, carved from the living rock of Luralis over three generations, its walls studded with bioluminescent crystals that cast everything in soft amber light. Woven tapestries depicting the Galorum family history hung between the crystal clusters—images of great-great-grandmother Galorum the Steady, who had founded the Warren; of ships passing through the stars; of children beyond counting.

Drennik could smell the feast being prepared in the kitchen three corridors away. Garenna had been cooking since dawn, even though she was only eight and technically still an apprentice. But Garenna had opinions about how celebration feasts should be prepared, and those opinions were delivered with such fierce conviction that even the adult cooks had learned to step aside.

"I smell honey-grain," Verrik whispered.

"Garenna's making birth cakes. She told me there would be eighteen layers. One for each of us."

"Including the new one?"

"Including the new one."

The door opened.

A hush fell over the hall, rippling outward from the entrance to the birthing chamber like rings in water. Drennik held his breath. Beside him, Verrik's small hand found his and gripped tight.

Elder Healer Torrush emerged first, her robes marked with the silver thread that denoted her rank. Behind her came the attending healers, and behind them—

Mother.

Galenna of Galorum walked slowly, one hand braced against the wall, the other cradling a bundle wrapped in the deep blue cloth reserved for Warren births. She looked exhausted, her skin paler than usual, the ridges of her face somehow both softened and sharpened by the ordeal. But she was smiling.

"A son," Torrush announced, her voice carrying to every corner of the hall. "Healthy. Strong. The eighteenth child of Galenna of Galorum."

The cheer that erupted made the crystals in the walls vibrate. Drennik shouted along with everyone else, bouncing on his feet until the gallery railing creaked in protest. Verrik covered his ears but was grinning.

The crowd parted to let Galenna pass toward the family dais at the hall's center, where a cushioned chair had been prepared for her. Drennik watched his mother sink into it with visible relief, the bundle in her arms stirring slightly at the noise.

"Name," someone called from the crowd. "What's his name?"

Galenna looked down at the infant. The hall fell quiet again, everyone straining to hear.

"Mornik," she said softly. "For my grandfather's grandfather, who first took our family to the stars."

Mornik. Drennik tested the name in his mind. It was a good name. Strong. Traditional. The kind of name that carried weight without being too heavy to bear.

The infant made a small sound—not quite a cry, more a vocalization of curiosity—and Drennik saw tiny fingers emerge from the wrapping to grasp at the air.

"Come," Galenna said, her voice carrying the particular authority of a mother who had given this command seventeen times before. "Come and meet your brother."

The siblings approached in order of age, as tradition demanded. Drennik watched from the gallery as Torvak—eldest, responsible, already balding slightly at thirty-five from the stress of being Warren administrator—stepped forward first. He took the infant formally, holding him at arm's length to examine him with the critical eye he applied to shipping manifests and trade agreements.

"Acceptable," Torvak pronounced, which from him was high praise. He passed the bundle to Kellura, who laughed at their brother's assessment and immediately pulled the infant close.

"He has mother's eyes," Kellura declared. "And father's nose. He'll be handsome."

"He'll be trouble," Brossik muttered, though Drennik saw the engineer's face soften as he took his turn holding the baby. Brossik always said every new sibling would be trouble. He'd said it about Verrik, about Solura, about Drennik himself. He was usually right.

Down the line the infant passed. Nalenna, who would probably end up teaching him. Durvo, who held him like cargo to be secured for transit. Tessik, who immediately began planning a painting to commemorate the birth. Vornak, Kelloss, Mellura—the twins handling the baby between them with practiced ease.

Then Prenna.

Drennik leaned forward, watching his favorite older sister take the infant. At twelve, Prenna was the sibling he trusted most, the one who bandaged his scrapes and listened to his complaints and never, ever told him he was being silly. She was training to be a healer, which meant she held the baby with careful, professional attention.

But then she leaned close and whispered something, her lips moving against the infant's ear. Drennik couldn't hear the words, but he saw the baby's hand reach up and grasp at her robes.

"What did she say?" Verrik asked.

"I don't know. Something secret."

Prenna had whispered to each of them, Drennik knew. She'd whispered to him when he was born, though of course he couldn't remember it. She'd told him once that she made a promise to each new sibling—a promise to look out for them, to be there when they needed her.

Drennik wondered what promise she'd made to Mornik.

The procession continued. Thurrik held the baby with competitive intensity, as if infant-holding were a sport he intended to win. Garenna emerged from the kitchen corridor just long enough to touch the baby's forehead and pronounce him "adequately sized," which was her way of approving of anything. Bolvus barely looked up from the book he'd brought with him, accepting the baby with one hand while continuing to read with the other.

Then it was Drennik's turn.

He scrambled down from the gallery and pushed through the crowd of extended family—cousins and aunts and uncles from the Warren's many branches, all gathered to witness the birth. The central dais seemed very high when he reached it, the cushioned chair very large, his mother looking down at him with knowing eyes.

"Ready, Drennik?"

He nodded, not trusting his voice.

Someone—Prenna, he thought—helped him onto the dais. The bundle was placed in his arms, and he looked down at his new brother for the first time.

Mornik was... small. Smaller than Drennik had expected. His skin had the greyish-purple cast of all Lurian infants, his eyes squeezed shut against the ambient light, his mouth working in the instinctive search for food. The ridges that would someday define his face were barely visible, smooth hillocks that would sharpen over decades.

"Hello," Drennik said, because he didn't know what else to say.

Mornik opened his eyes. They were dark, almost black, and they seemed to look directly at Drennik with an intensity that made him shiver.

"He's staring at me."

"He can barely see yet," Prenna said gently. "He's just responding to your voice."

"No." Drennik shook his head. "He's *looking* at me. He knows I'm his brother."

Galenna laughed—a tired, warm sound. "Perhaps he does. Mornik is the eighteenth. He has much to learn from all of you."

Drennik looked down at the baby again. Mornik had stopped staring, his eyes drifting closed as the excitement of being passed around caught up with him. One small hand had escaped the blanket entirely and was resting against Drennik's chest, the fingers curled loosely.

"I'm going to teach you everything," Drennik whispered. "All the best hiding spots. Where Garenna keeps the extra sweets. How to get Thurrik to chase you without getting caught. Everything."

He wasn't sure if he imagined the baby's smile.

Solura sang a lullaby as she held him—she was only three, but she'd been singing since she could speak. Verrik, last before the newborn himself, simply stared at Mornik with the confused possessiveness of a child who had just been displaced from his position as youngest.

"He's smaller than me," Verrik announced, as if this were a significant observation.

"For now," Kellura said. "Give him time."

The formal presentation complete, the family gathered in a loose semicircle around the dais. Drennik counted heads: seventeen siblings, ranging from Torvak's looming height to Verrik's stubborn smallness. Beyond them, the extended Warren—aunts, uncles, cousins, elders. Beyond that, glimpsed through doorways and stairwells, the Warren compound itself. The upper living quarters, warm with stored sunlight. The cooling stairs that led down to the underground sleeping chambers. The cargo bay where crates from their shipping business were stacked three high. The kitchen corridor, from which the scent of Garenna's feast still drifted.

All of this, Drennik thought. All of this is what Mornik has been born into.

He tried to imagine what it would be like to be the eighteenth. To have seventeen siblings ahead of you, each with their own personality and position and claim on their parents' attention. To be the youngest in a family that seemed to expand without limit.

It seemed overwhelming. It seemed wonderful.

Galenna stood, slowly, accepting assistance from Torrush. She was still holding Mornik, the infant sleeping peacefully against her chest. She looked at her children—all eighteen of them now—and her expression held something Drennik couldn't quite identify. Pride, certainly. Exhaustion, definitely. But also something deeper.

"The Warren grows," she said.

The response came from everywhere at once, from siblings and cousins and aunts and uncles, from healers and elders and the distant kitchen where Garenna had paused in her cooking to speak the words, from the very stones of the compound that had heard this ritual a thousand times before:

"And in growing, endures."

Mornik slept on, unaware of the world he had entered. Unaware that he was one small piece of a vast tapestry that stretched back generations and would stretch forward for generations more. Unaware that somewhere, many years in the future, he would sit alone at a bar on a distant space station and find a different kind of family.

But that was yet to come.

For now, he was simply Mornik of Galorum Warren, eighteenth child of Galenna, one among many.

And in the great hall of his family's compound, surrounded by the warmth of belonging, he dreamed his first dreams of stars.
