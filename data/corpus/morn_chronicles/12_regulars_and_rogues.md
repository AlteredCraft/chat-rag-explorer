# Chapter 12: Regulars and Rogues

The crate weighed more than it should have for something Lady Vestris described as "a small ceremonial piece." Morn loaded it into his cargo hold with the careful attention he gave all of her shipments—which was to say, he didn't look too closely at the contents, didn't ask questions about provenance, and made absolutely certain nothing got scratched.

"You're worried," Lady Vestris said from behind him.

Morn turned, finding the Betazoid woman watching him with those dark, unreadable eyes. She was perhaps a hundred and twenty, still young by her species' standards, her silver-streaked black hair arranged in elaborate coils that probably cost more than his ship. She wore robes of deep burgundy that somehow managed to look both casual and worth a small fortune.

"Not worried," Morn said, securing the crate's restraints. "Just careful. There's a difference."

"There is," she agreed. "Most people don't know that. You do." She tilted her head slightly, and Morn felt the familiar sensation of being read—not his thoughts, she wasn't that kind of telepath, but his emotional state laid bare like cargo manifest. "You're genuinely not worried. You're... professionally cautious. And slightly hungry. Did you eat breakfast?"

"I had something."

"Something insufficient, clearly." She waved a hand, and one of her servants appeared with a small basket. "Betazoid pastries. The blue ones are filled with something your digestive system can't process, so avoid those. The rest should be fine."

Morn accepted the basket with the grace of someone who'd learned that refusing Lady Vestris's generosity was more trouble than accepting it. "You don't have to—"

"I know I don't have to. That's what makes it a gift rather than an obligation." She smiled, and despite himself, Morn smiled back. "This is why I like you, Morn. Your emotions are so... uncomplicated. You're happy when you receive kindness. You're satisfied when work goes well. You're concerned when there's genuine cause for concern. It's refreshing."

"Compared to what?"

"Compared to everyone else I deal with." She gestured vaguely at the estate grounds behind her—manicured gardens that stretched to distant hills, a manor house that could have housed a small colony. "Politicians whose smiles hide contempt. Dealers whose warmth masks calculation. Collectors whose enthusiasm covers desperation." She fixed him with a look that was probably seeing straight through to his core. "You actually enjoy your work. You actually like flying. You actually find me pleasant company rather than merely profitable."

"Guilty on all counts," Morn admitted.

"See? Uncomplicated." She reached into her robes and produced a data chip. "Payment for this delivery, plus the next three at standard rates. I have a series of acquisitions coming through over the next few months. Excavations on Risa, Bajor, and somewhere I'm not supposed to know about."

Morn pocketed the chip without checking the amount. He'd learned early that Lady Vestris always paid fairly—more than fairly, actually—and that verifying the numbers in front of her was considered gauche. "Same protocols as usual?"

"Discreet transport, no customs declarations unless absolutely necessary, careful handling, and absolute silence about origins." She paused. "The Bajoran piece especially. There are some... questions about who technically owns artifacts from the Occupation era."

"I don't have opinions about artifact ownership," Morn said. "I just move cargo."

"Yes, you do. And you do it well." She studied him again with that penetrating gaze. "You know what I appreciate most about you, Morn? You talk constantly. Hours of conversation, stories, jokes, observations about everything you see. And somehow, you never actually say anything about the things that matter."

"I'm not sure if that's a compliment."

"It's an observation." She smiled again, warmer this time. "It's also why I trust you. Safe travels, Morn. Don't forget to eat the pastries."

The Twins always met him at the same location—a repair station orbiting a gas giant in a system with no name, just a catalog number. The station was technically abandoned, which meant it was actually quite busy with people who preferred to conduct business away from official notice.

Koss and Venn were waiting in the usual bay, their identical Yridian faces arranged in identical expressions of professional neutrality. Morn had worked with them for nearly a decade and still couldn't tell them apart. He suspected this was intentional.

"Morn," one of them said—Koss, probably, based on nothing but random chance. "You're early."

"Traffic was light." Morn descended the ramp and extended his hand for the cargo. "Three chips, same destination as last time?"

"Four chips," the other one—Venn—said. "Different destination. New client."

Morn accepted the small case they handed him. Four isolinear chips, each one probably containing information that could ruin someone's life, career, or both. He didn't ask what was on them. He'd learned early that the Twins didn't appreciate questions, and that their work existed in a realm of ethical ambiguity he preferred not to examine too closely.

"The destination is a station in the Kalandra sector," Koss said. "You'll be met by a human woman, red hair, answers to the name Teris. She'll have the authentication code."

"Payment on delivery or—"

"Half now, half on confirmation." Venn produced a credit chip. "The new client is... particular. They want assurance that the delivery will be timely and discreet."

"I'm always discreet."

"Yes," Koss said, and something that might have been amusement flickered across his ridged face. "That's why we use you."

Morn secured the case in his jacket. "Can I ask one question? Not about the cargo."

The Twins exchanged a look that communicated something Morn couldn't read. "Ask."

"Why me? You must have dozens of couriers. Faster ships, better connections, more experience with this kind of work."

"We do," Venn acknowledged. "But they're professionals."

"And I'm not?"

"You're something else." Koss leaned against a support beam, his posture casual but his eyes sharp. "Professional couriers have professional discretion. They keep quiet because it's their job, because they're paid to, because they understand the consequences of talking. That's reliable, but it's also... conditional."

"You're reliable in a different way," Venn continued. "You talk all the time. You can't help it. People know this about you. They expect it. And because you talk about everything else, they assume you talk about everything." He paused. "But you don't."

"You keep the things that matter separate," Koss said. "Not because you're trained to or paid to, but because it genuinely doesn't occur to you to share them. It's not discretion. It's just... you."

Morn wasn't sure how to respond to that. "I think that's a compliment?"

"It's a statement of fact." The Twins spoke in unison, which was unsettling. "Safe travels, Morn. We'll be in touch about the next shipment."

Grint's message came through encrypted channels, which meant either the job was sensitive or the old Ferengi was feeling dramatic. Knowing Grint, probably both.

They met on Torsus IV, at a bar that catered to traders, smugglers, and people who didn't want to be either but found themselves adjacent to both. Grint was waiting in a back booth, his aged features creased with the satisfaction of someone who'd made money that day.

"Morn!" He stood—still shorter than Morn remembered, though that was probably age settling both of them—and gestured to the opposite seat. "Sit, sit. I ordered something for you. Probably terrible, but that's what you get on frontier worlds."

Morn slid into the booth. "Your message said you had a job."

"I have several jobs. Some of them might even be legal." Grint's eyes twinkled with familiar mischief. "But that's not why I asked you here."

"It's not?"

"No." Grint leaned forward, his voice dropping despite the ambient noise that already made their conversation private. "I want to introduce you to someone. A contact of mine who's been asking about you."

"Asking about me how?"

"The usual way. Wants to know if you're reliable, discreet, capable of handling sensitive work." Grint waved a dismissive hand. "I told him you're all of those things and also terrible at keeping your mouth shut, which makes you the most trustworthy person in the quadrant."

"Everyone keeps saying that. I'm not sure it's the compliment people think it is."

"It's not a compliment. It's a character assessment." Grint signaled for drinks. "His name is Hain. I've worked with him on and off for about twenty years. Intelligent, connected, always pays on time. He runs a network of... let's call them logistics specialists. People who move things that need moving, no questions asked."

"Sounds like what I already do."

"It is what you already do. But bigger. More organized. Better paying." Grint accepted the drinks that arrived and slid one to Morn. "He's been cultivating you for a while. Using intermediaries, setting up jobs through third parties, watching how you handle things."

Morn felt something cold settle in his stomach. "Watching me."

"Don't take it personally. He does this with everyone he considers bringing into his network. He's careful. Thorough." Grint took a long sip of his drink. "He's also here tonight. Wants to meet you face to face."

"And you're just telling me this now?"

"Would you have come if I'd told you earlier?" Grint smiled, showing teeth. "You'd have had questions, concerns, wanted to think about it. This way, you can meet him, form your own opinion, and then decide."

Morn wanted to argue, but Grint had a point. Given time to consider, he probably would have found reasons to decline. Meeting new contacts who'd been "watching" him wasn't typically how he preferred to do business.

"Fine," he said. "Where is he?"

Grint nodded toward the bar's entrance. "Just walked in."

Morn turned.

The man approaching their booth was humanoid—mostly. Morn couldn't quite place his species. Something in the bone structure of his face suggested Cardassian ancestry, but the eyes were wrong, too warm. He moved like someone who knew exactly how much space he occupied and how to use it. Late middle age by human standards, perhaps, but that meant nothing with species Morn couldn't identify.

"Morn." The man's voice was pleasant, melodic, the kind of voice that could sell you anything and make you feel good about buying. "I'm Hain. I've heard quite a lot about you."

He slid into the booth beside Grint, and Morn noticed how naturally he commanded the space. Not aggressive, not domineering—just present in a way that made everyone else feel slightly less substantial.

"Grint tells me you've been... following my career," Morn said.

"Following suggests something clandestine." Hain smiled. "I prefer to think of it as professional interest. You've built quite a reputation over the years. Reliable, personable, and remarkably good at keeping the right kinds of secrets."

"Everyone keeps telling me that."

"Because it's true. And in my line of work, that kind of reliability is valuable." Hain accepted a drink that appeared without his apparently having ordered it—the bartender knew him, then. "I have a proposition for you, Morn. Nothing immediate, nothing that requires a decision tonight. But I think you might be interested."

"What kind of proposition?"

Hain's smile widened slightly, and something in his eyes shifted—not threatening, exactly, but suddenly deeper than before. Morn had the unsettling sense of being assessed, measured, and found potentially useful.

"The kind that could change everything," Hain said. "But we'll discuss the details later. For now, let's just say I think we could help each other. You have skills I need. I have opportunities you might find... interesting."

Morn looked at Grint, who shrugged with elaborate innocence. He looked back at Hain, at those too-warm eyes and that too-pleasant smile, and felt the distinct sensation of standing at the edge of something significant.

"I'm listening," he said.

Hain's smile became something else entirely—satisfied, perhaps, or triumphant.

"Good," he said. "That's a start."
