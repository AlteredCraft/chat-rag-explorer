# Chapter 19: The Betrayal

Morn woke to the sensation of being watched.

It was not the gradual emergence from sleep, the slow surfacing through layers of consciousness. It was instantaneous—one moment nothing, the next total alertness, his body flooding with adrenaline before his mind could process why.

Krit and Nahsk stood over his bed.

In the darkness of the safehouse, their faces were shadows with teeth. Krit held something that caught the faint light from the doorway—a disruptor, aimed at Morn's chest. Nahsk stood slightly back, his massive frame blocking any path to the window.

Morn's hearts began to pound. Both of them, hammering against his kelvu in a rhythm of pure terror.

"Don't move." Krit's voice was almost pleasant. "Don't even think about it."

Morn's eyes darted to the doorway. Hain stood there, silhouetted against the dim light of the corridor. His posture was relaxed, hands clasped behind his back, as if this were a routine meeting rather than an execution.

And behind Hain—

Larell.

She stood in the shadows, her arms wrapped around herself, her eyes fixed on the floor. She wouldn't look at him. Couldn't look at him.

"Larell?" His voice cracked on her name.

She flinched but didn't respond.

Hain stepped forward, his boots making soft sounds on the floor. "I imagine you have questions," he said. "That's natural. You deserve answers, given what you've contributed to our enterprise."

"Hain." Morn pushed himself up slightly, and Krit's disruptor tracked his movement with mechanical precision. "What is this? What's happening?"

"What's happening," Hain said, settling into a chair near the bed with the air of a man who had all the time in the world, "is the conclusion of a plan that was set in motion long before you agreed to join us."

The words didn't make sense. Morn's mind scrambled to process them, to find some interpretation that didn't mean what it obviously meant.

"I don't understand."

"Yes, you do." Hain's voice was patient, almost kind. "You're understanding right now. I can see it in your face."

Morn looked at Larell again. She still wouldn't meet his eyes.

"The original plan," Hain continued, "was always to eliminate you after extraction. Once the latinum was safely stored in that remarkable organ of yours, once we were away from the Draylon system and had time to prepare, you would be... removed from the equation."

"Removed," Morn repeated. The word felt foreign in his mouth.

"You're a liability, Morn. Surely you must see that." Hain spread his hands. "You talk too much. You form attachments. You have—and I mean this as an observation, not a criticism—too soft a conscience. Give it a year, maybe two, and the guilt would eat at you. You'd find a counselor, or a bartender, or some sympathetic stranger, and you'd confess. Not everything, perhaps. But enough."

"I wouldn't—"

"You would." The certainty in Hain's voice was absolute. "We've worked together for months now. I know you. The weight of what we did at Lissepian Trading would destroy you eventually. And when you broke, you'd take us all down with you."

Morn's mind raced. He thought of his mother, who believed he was establishing himself in the transport business. He thought of the latinum pressing against his organs, the fortune he carried inside him. He thought of Larell's hands on his face two nights ago, her whispered words in the darkness.

"The latinum," he said. "I'll extract it now. All of it. Your shares, everything. Just let me—"

"That was going to be our next step regardless," Hain said. "We'll need to remove it before... well. The physical process of extraction is somewhat violent. Better that you're alive for it."

The clinical way Hain discussed his murder made Morn's stomach lurch.

"I'll disappear," he said desperately. "You'll never see me again. I'll go to the far side of the quadrant. I'll—"

"And risk you surfacing in ten years with a guilty conscience and a need for absolution?" Hain shook his head. "No. This is cleaner. I'm sorry, Morn. I truly am. You've been an excellent partner. But this was always the plan."

"For all of you?" Morn looked at Krit, at Nahsk. "You all knew?"

Nahsk's massive shoulders shifted uncomfortably, but he said nothing. Krit just smiled.

"From the beginning," Krit confirmed. "Why do you think we were so friendly? We needed you compliant."

The betrayal hit Morn in waves. Every shared meal, every late-night planning session, every moment of camaraderie—all of it calculated. All of it false.

But Larell—

"Larell." He said her name again, putting everything into it. "Tell me you didn't know. Tell me this wasn't—"

"Morn." Her voice was barely a whisper. She still wouldn't look at him.

"Larell was instrumental in keeping you committed to the operation," Hain said. "When we identified you as our kelvu-carrying candidate, we knew we'd need someone to ensure your loyalty. Someone who could make you feel... invested."

The room spun. Morn thought he might vomit.

"No," he said. "That's not—what we had was real. Tell him, Larell. Tell him it was real."

Finally, she looked up. Her eyes were wet, her face twisted with something that might have been genuine pain.

"I'm sorry, Morn," she said. "I really am."

And he saw that she meant it. He could see the regret in every line of her body, could hear the sincerity in her voice. She was sorry. She cared about him, maybe even loved him in her way.

And it didn't matter.

It didn't matter because she was still standing behind Hain. Still letting this happen. Still choosing her survival over his life.

"Larell, please—"

"I can't." The words seemed torn from her. "I'm sorry. I can't."

Hain rose from his chair. "Enough sentiment. Krit, Nahsk—restrain him. We'll begin the extraction and then—"

"Wait." The word came out before Morn could think. "Wait, please. Just... let me tell you something first."

Krit glanced at Hain, who raised an eyebrow.

"Indulge me," Hain said. "What could you possibly have to say?"

Morn's mind raced. He had nothing—no weapon, no plan, no hope of fighting his way out. Krit and Nahsk would break him in seconds. His only option was to stall, to buy time, to hope for some miracle he couldn't imagine.

So he did what he'd always done. What had gotten him into trouble his whole life. What his mother had begged him to control.

He talked.

"My mother," he said, the words tumbling out in a rush. "She lives on Luria, in a small dwelling near the Singing Cliffs. She thinks I'm establishing a transport business. She thinks I'm finally making something of myself. Every month, I send her a message telling her about cargo runs I never made and clients I never met. She's so proud of me, Hain. So proud. And when I don't come home, when I disappear, she'll never know what happened. She'll spend the rest of her life wondering if I'm alive, if I'm suffering somewhere, if I abandoned her."

Krit's smile faltered slightly. Nahsk shifted his weight.

"My father died when I was young," Morn continued, his voice rising. "Did I ever tell you that? Killed in a mining accident. My mother raised me alone. She worked double shifts at the processing plant. She gave me everything, sacrificed everything, and I repaid her by becoming a thief. A criminal. A disgrace to everything she taught me."

"Morn—" Hain's voice carried a note of warning.

"And you know what the worst part is?" Morn was crying now, tears streaming down his face, his words coming faster and faster. "The worst part is that she'd forgive me. If she knew everything—the heist, the latinum, all of it—she'd forgive me. Because that's what mothers do. That's what love does. It forgives. It keeps forgiving. Even when it shouldn't."

Krit looked bored. He glanced at Nahsk, rolled his eyes.

"Are you quite finished?" Hain asked.

"No." Morn's voice cracked. "No, I'm not finished. I have so many regrets, Hain. So many things I wish I'd done differently. I should have told my mother the truth. I should have been honest with her from the start. I should have—"

"This is tedious," Krit muttered. He turned to Hain. "Can we just get on with it?"

That was the moment.

Krit's attention had shifted. Nahsk was looking at Hain for guidance, waiting for the order. Hain's eyes were on his crew, irritation flickering across his features.

And Larell—

Larell was looking at Morn. Really looking at him. And in her eyes, he saw something that might have been permission.

Morn moved.

He didn't think. Thinking would have paralyzed him. He just threw himself off the bed in the opposite direction from Krit, toward the small window that led to the exterior landing pad.

Krit's disruptor fired. The shot went wide, searing the wall where Morn's head had been a heartbeat before.

"Get him!" Hain's voice, sharp with surprise.

Morn crashed through the window. The glass cut his arms, his face, but he barely felt it. He hit the ground running, his bare feet slapping against the cold metal of the landing pad.

The *Patient Ear* was fifty meters away.

He ran.

Behind him, he heard shouting. Krit and Nahsk were coming through the window. Hain was calling for someone to get to the other ship, to cut him off.

Forty meters.

Morn's lungs burned. He was not built for running—his species had evolved for endurance, not speed. But terror gave him wings.

Thirty meters.

A disruptor shot screamed past his ear. He ducked, stumbled, kept running.

Twenty meters.

He could see the *Patient Ear's* hull gleaming in the starlight. His ship. The one thing in the universe that was truly his.

Ten meters.

He slammed his palm against the access panel. For one horrible moment, nothing happened. Then the door hissed open, and Morn threw himself inside.

"Close! Close!" He scrambled toward the cockpit, not waiting to see if the door obeyed.

More disruptor fire. The hull shook with impacts. The *Patient Ear* was a freighter, not a warship—it wouldn't survive sustained assault.

Morn's fingers flew across the controls. Power-up sequence. Engine initialization. Navigation systems coming online.

Through the viewport, he saw Krit and Nahsk running toward the ship. Hain was behind them, already turning toward their own vessel.

The engines hummed to life.

Morn didn't wait for full power. He didn't run diagnostics or check systems. He just grabbed the controls and pushed.

The *Patient Ear* lurched skyward. The sudden acceleration threw Morn against his seat, but he held on, kept climbing, kept pushing.

The planet's atmosphere tore at the hull. Warning lights flashed across the console—too fast, too steep, structural stress exceeding tolerances. Morn ignored them all.

He punched in coordinates at random—anywhere, it didn't matter, just away. His fingers trembled so badly he could barely hit the right keys.

Behind him, on the planet's surface, he imagined Hain reaching his ship. Imagined the pursuit that would follow.

The warp drive was still warming up. It needed another thirty seconds.

Morn stared at the countdown, his hearts pounding.

Twenty seconds.

He thought of Larell's face. The way she'd looked at him in that final moment.

Ten seconds.

He thought of his mother, who would never know what happened to her son.

Five seconds.

He thought of the latinum inside him, the fortune that had cost him everything.

The warp drive engaged.

Stars stretched into lines. The *Patient Ear* jumped, and the Draylon system vanished behind him.

Morn sat in the pilot's chair, shaking. His arms were bleeding from the window glass. His feet were cut and bruised. His whole body ached from the desperate sprint.

But he was alive.

He was alive, and he was alone, and he was carrying one thousand bricks of gold-pressed latinum in his second stomach.

He couldn't go home. Hain would look for him there. He couldn't contact anyone he knew—Hain knew all his associates, all his contacts, all the places he might run.

He had to disappear. Completely. Permanently.

Morn looked at the stars streaming past the viewport. Somewhere out there was a place where no one knew him. A place where he could start over, become someone new, bury Morn of Luria so deep that even Hain would never find him.

He thought of Larell's final words. *I'm sorry, Morn. I really am.*

And he thought of his mother, alone on Luria, waiting for messages that would never come.

A sound escaped him. It might have been a laugh. It might have been a sob. He couldn't tell anymore.

The *Patient Ear* flew on through the darkness, carrying its pilot toward an unknown future.

He could never go home.

He was utterly alone.

And somewhere behind him, four people were dividing up his share of a fortune he still carried inside him, planning how to find him, how to finish what they'd started.

Morn set a course for the deepest, most remote sector he could think of. And then he sat in the darkness of his cockpit, bleeding and broken, and began to plan the rest of his life.
