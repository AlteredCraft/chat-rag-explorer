# Chapter 23: The Occupation Ends

The evacuation began at 0400 hours, though Morn had been awake for two days.

He sat at his usual stool in Quark's, watching through the bar's entrance as Cardassian soldiers marched past in disciplined columns. Their boots struck the deck plating in perfect rhythm, a sound that had once meant terror and now meant something else entirely. Departure. Withdrawal. The end of half a century of occupation.

Quark stood behind the bar, polishing the same glass he'd been polishing for an hour. His hands moved mechanically, but his eyes tracked every soldier, every crate of supplies being loaded onto transport ships, every piece of equipment being stripped from the walls.

"They're taking everything," Quark muttered. "Look at them. The replicators, the power conduits, the ore processing manifolds. They're going to leave nothing but a shell."

Morn said nothing. He watched a Cardassian technician pry a display panel from the wall of the Promenade, revealing the ugly guts of infrastructure beneath. The soldier handled it carelessly, letting it clatter to the deck before tossing it onto a hovercart already piled high with salvage.

This was spite, not strategy. The Cardassians were leaving Bajor, but they were determined to leave nothing of value behind.

"Forty years I've been here," Quark continued, though Morn hadn't asked. "Forty years building this establishment, cultivating relationships, developing a clientele. And now—" He gestured at the empty bar. "Now I don't even know who's going to be in charge tomorrow."

A reasonable fear. Morn had considered it himself. The Bajoran Provisional Government was taking control of the station, but they'd requested Federation assistance. Starfleet was coming. New laws, new regulations, new scrutiny of business practices that had flourished under Cardassian corruption.

And new investigations, potentially, into old crimes.

Morn lifted his glass—the dregs of last night's synthale, warm and flat—and drained it. He'd survived Cardassian security sweeps, Bajoran resistance cell purges, and two separate attempts on his life by parties who'd never identified themselves. He could survive a change in administration.

Or he could run.

The thought had occurred to him several times over the past week, as rumors of the withdrawal solidified into fact. He had resources. He had contacts on a dozen worlds. He could disappear, reinvent himself again, find another bar on another station where no one knew his name or his history.

But he was tired. Bone-deep tired in a way that had nothing to do with the sleepless nights. He was tired of running, tired of watching over his shoulder, tired of the constant low-grade anxiety that came with maintaining a false identity. He'd been Morn for over a decade now. Somewhere along the way, the mask had become the face.

The last column of Cardassian soldiers passed the bar's entrance. Behind them came a pair of Bajoran workers, already beginning to remove the Cardassian signage from the bulkheads. One of them caught Morn's eye and nodded—a gesture of shared survival, one witness to another.

Morn nodded back.

The Federation vessel arrived three days later.

Morn was on the Promenade when the U.S.S. Enterprise docked, though he kept his distance from the crowds of Bajorans who'd gathered to watch. Some cheered. Others wept. A few simply stood in silence, as overwhelmed as Morn himself by the magnitude of what was happening.

The occupation was over. Really, truly over.

He watched the airlock cycle open and a delegation emerge. Starfleet officers in their distinctive uniforms, moving with the confident stride of people who expected to be in charge. Bajoran officials in civilian dress, their expressions a complicated mixture of pride and anxiety. And behind them, more Starfleet personnel—engineers, by the look of their equipment, already assessing the damage the Cardassians had inflicted in their departure.

Morn catalogued faces from the shadows of an alcove. The tall human who walked at the front of the Starfleet contingent, dark-skinned and bearing himself with quiet authority—that would be the new commander, he assumed. Sisko, the rumors said. Benjamin Sisko. A man with a reputation, though Morn hadn't been able to gather many details.

Beside him walked a Bajoran woman, her bearing military despite her civilian clothing. She moved like someone who'd spent years fighting, and the way her eyes scanned the crowd suggested she was still looking for threats. First officer, perhaps. Or liaison. Morn made a mental note to learn more about her.

And behind them—

Morn's attention snagged on a figure he didn't recognize. Humanoid, but with skin that seemed almost too smooth, features that were somehow not quite right. The being moved with an odd precision, and its eyes swept the crowd with an intensity that made Morn's instincts prickle.

A shapeshifter. He'd heard rumors of such a being on the station during the occupation, working as a security officer under the Cardassians. Odo, they called him. A constable without allegiance to any government, interested only in justice—or his version of it.

Those amber eyes passed over Morn's position, and for a moment, Morn felt certain the shapeshifter had seen him. Had catalogued him. Had filed him away for future investigation.

He forced himself not to look away. Guilty men looked away. Morn was just another face in the crowd.

After a moment, the constable's gaze moved on.

Quark's negotiation with Commander Sisko happened four days after the Federation's arrival.

Morn watched from his stool—his unofficial position in the establishment, maintained through years of consistent patronage and reliable discretion. Quark had considered closing the bar during the transition, but Morn had counseled otherwise. Stay open. Appear cooperative. Show the new administration that Quark's was an asset, not a liability.

Quark had listened, for once.

Now the Ferengi stood in his own establishment, facing the new commander across a table near the back. Morn couldn't hear their conversation from his position at the bar, but he didn't need to. Body language told the story clearly enough.

Sisko sat with his hands folded, his posture relaxed but his expression serious. He spoke in short sentences, each one prompting a reaction from Quark. The Ferengi gestured expansively at first, then more defensively, then with something approaching desperation.

Morn sipped his drink—actual Andorian ale, now that supply lines were reopening—and watched the negotiation unfold.

Quark was panicking. His ears were flushed, a sure sign of elevated stress. He kept glancing toward the bar, toward the gaming tables, toward the holosuites on the upper level—inventorying his assets, calculating his losses, preparing for the worst.

But Sisko's expression wasn't hostile. It was... calculating. The commander was evaluating Quark not as a criminal to be dealt with, but as a resource to be managed. Morn had seen that look before, on the faces of Cardassian administrators who'd recognized that pure brutality was less effective than strategic tolerance.

Sisko needed something. Something Quark could provide.

The conversation continued for another twenty minutes. Near the end, Sisko said something that made Quark's entire demeanor change. The Ferengi's shoulders dropped. His hands stopped moving. He stared at the commander for a long moment, then nodded slowly.

They shook hands—an oddly human gesture for Quark to accept—and Sisko departed.

Quark returned to the bar in a daze. He poured himself a drink with trembling hands, drained it in one swallow, then poured another.

"Well?" Morn prompted.

Quark looked at him. For perhaps the first time since Morn had known him, the Ferengi seemed genuinely at a loss for words.

"We're staying," he finally said. "Both of us."

Morn raised his glass in a silent toast. Quark clinked his own against it, and they drank together while the future of the station rearranged itself around them.

The days that followed brought new faces and new rhythms.

Morn observed from his position at the bar, cataloguing the station's new inhabitants with the same care he'd once devoted to survival. The chief of operations, a human named O'Brien, spent most of his time cursing at Cardassian engineering as he fought to restore systems the occupation forces had sabotaged. The science officer, a Trill named Dax, moved through the station with an easy grace that suggested centuries of experience compressed into a single lifetime.

The constable—Odo—patrolled the Promenade with methodical regularity. His eyes swept every corner, catalogued every face, noted every transaction. When his gaze landed on Morn, it lingered for a moment longer than strictly necessary.

Morn met that gaze without flinching. He'd done nothing wrong. Not recently, at least. And the crimes of his past were beyond any jurisdiction this constable might claim.

Probably.

The Bajoran first officer—Kira, he learned—came to Quark's exactly once during that first week. She ordered a glass of spring wine, drank half of it, and departed without speaking to anyone. Her expression suggested she found the establishment distasteful, but her presence suggested she was willing to tolerate it.

That was enough, for now.

The renaming ceremony was held on what the Federation designated as Stardate 46379.1.

Morn stood at the edge of the crowd on the Promenade, watching as Commander Sisko addressed the assembled personnel. Bajoran officials stood on one side of the raised platform, Starfleet officers on the other. Behind them, a large display showed the station's new designation in both Federation Standard and Bajoran script.

Deep Space Nine.

A name that meant nothing, historically speaking. A numerical designation for a remote outpost on the edge of known space. But for the beings who called this station home, it meant something more. It meant a new beginning. A fresh start. The end of one era and the birth of another.

Sisko's speech was brief and appropriate. He acknowledged the suffering of the Bajoran people. He honored their resilience. He pledged Federation support in their recovery. He did not promise miracles, but he offered hope.

The crowd applauded when he finished. Some cheered. A few wept.

Morn did neither. He simply stood and watched, a silent witness to history unfolding around him.

He could have been anywhere in the galaxy. He could have fled when the Cardassians withdrew, disappeared into the chaos of the transition. He could have reinvented himself again, found another station, another bar, another life.

But he was here. He'd chosen to stay.

The reasons were complicated—exhaustion, perhaps, or inertia, or something approaching attachment to this ugly metal home he'd inhabited for so many years. But beneath all of those, there was something simpler. Something he hadn't allowed himself to feel in decades.

He was tired of running. Tired of looking over his shoulder. Tired of being afraid.

If the past caught up with him here, so be it. He would face it. He would deal with it. Or he wouldn't, and his story would end on this station that had witnessed so much suffering and was now reaching, tentatively, toward something better.

The crowd began to disperse. Quark emerged from his establishment, wiping his hands on a towel, and surveyed the Promenade with the calculating eye of a businessman assessing his market.

"New opportunities," the Ferengi said, half to himself and half to Morn. "New customers. New angles." He grinned, his earlier panic forgotten. "This is going to be profitable. I can feel it."

Morn said nothing. He turned and walked back into Quark's, reclaiming his stool at the bar. Through the entrance, he could see the last stragglers from the ceremony making their way to their quarters, their duty stations, their uncertain futures.

Deep Space Nine.

He was home.
