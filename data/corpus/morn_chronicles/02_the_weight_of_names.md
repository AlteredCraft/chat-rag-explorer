# Chapter 2: The Weight of Names

The Hall of Names smelled of stone dust and centuries.

Mornik—Morn, as everyone had called him since his fifth year—stood alone in the corridor, his fingers tracing the carved letters of a plaque so old the stone had worn smooth as river glass. The name read THURVENIX, and according to family legend, this particular Thurvenix had once talked a Klingon raiding party into leaving Galorum Warren unmolested by describing, in exhaustive detail, the seventeen steps required to properly cure lughorn meat.

The Klingons had been so bored they'd simply left.

Morn liked that story. He liked most of the stories in this hall—the grand ones and the small ones, the triumphant and the quietly dignified. But today, with his mother's reminder that he needed to "start seriously considering" his True Name echoing in his skull, the Hall of Names felt less like a gallery of inspiration and more like a gallery of judgment.

*They're all watching*, he thought, and immediately felt foolish. The names were carved stone. They couldn't watch anything.

But the weight of them pressed down nonetheless.

He was fifteen years old—young by any measure, with his First Molt still fifteen or twenty years distant—but tradition demanded that Lurians begin contemplating their True Name early. "A name chosen in haste is worn in regret," went the saying, usually delivered by elders who seemed to think any choice made before age fifty qualified as hasty.

Morn moved down the corridor, past names bold and humble. KORVANTHOR. DENNA. BELLIX THE STEADFAST. SIMPLE TARN. Each plaque bore not just a name but a life compressed into a few square centimeters of carved stone. Some included honorifics added after death: THE BRAVE, THE GENEROUS, THE ONE WHO FINALLY FIXED THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM.

That last one had always made Morn smile. There was something reassuring about a warren that valued functional plumbing alongside martial valor.

"You're here again."

Morn's secondary eyelid flickered in surprise as he turned. His sister Prenna stood at the corridor's entrance, her healer's satchel slung across one shoulder, her expression caught between amusement and concern.

"I'm researching," Morn said.

"You're brooding."

"Those aren't mutually exclusive."

Prenna walked toward him, her footsteps echoing softly off the curved walls. At twenty-seven, she'd completed her First Molt three years ago and chosen the True Name "Prenna" with such quiet confidence that Morn had spent weeks trying to understand how anyone could be that certain about anything.

"Let me guess," she said, stopping beside him. "You've been here since morning meal, you've traced approximately forty names, and you're no closer to choosing your own."

"Forty-three," Morn corrected. "And I've eliminated several possibilities."

"Such as?"

"Thurvenix. Already taken." He gestured at the ancient plaque. "Also, I'm not sure I could talk a Klingon into anything except possibly hitting me."

Prenna's laugh was warm and familiar. "You undersell yourself, little brother. I've seen you talk Drennik out of at least six terrible ideas this season alone."

"Drennik's not a Klingon."

"Some days it's hard to tell the difference."

That earned a reluctant smile. Drennik, at nineteen, had embraced his pre-Molt years as an extended opportunity to test exactly how much trouble one Lurian could cause without technically being exiled. Last month he'd convinced a group of visiting traders that Galorum Warren suffered from a rare condition that required all business to be conducted in whispers. The traders had spent three days speaking in hushed tones before someone finally explained the joke.

"Mother sent me to find you," Prenna said. "She wants to talk."

Morn's stomach tightened. "About names?"

"She didn't say. But given that you've been haunting this corridor for three days, I'd wager yes."

"I'm not haunting. Haunting implies—"

"Morn." Prenna touched his arm, her expression softening. "It's just a name. It's not a prophecy."

"Easy for you to say. You chose yours like it was nothing."

"It wasn't nothing." Something flickered in his sister's eyes—a shadow of old uncertainty. "I just hid the panic better than you do."

Before Morn could respond, Prenna was already walking away. "She's in the upper garden. Don't keep her waiting."

---

The upper garden was less a garden and more an ambitious attempt to convince plants to grow in a space that received approximately two hours of direct sunlight per day. Galorum Warren had been carved into a hillside three thousand years ago by ancestors who valued defensibility over horticulture, and the results spoke for themselves: hardy moss, stubborn fungi, and one eternally struggling vine that the family had named Persistent Vellix after a great-aunt known for her refusal to acknowledge defeat.

Galenna sat on a stone bench beside Persistent Vellix, her hands folded in her lap, her expression the particular kind of patient that meant she'd been waiting longer than she'd like.

"You found the Hall of Names comfortable, I take it?" she asked as Morn approached.

"The stones are very smooth."

"They should be. Generations of anxious young Lurians have worn them down with their pacing." She patted the bench beside her. "Sit."

Morn sat. His mother smelled of kitchen spices and the mineral tang of deep-warren stone—the smells of home, as constant as the walls themselves.

"You've been quiet lately," Galenna said. "Well. Quiet for you."

"I've been thinking."

"I noticed. Thinking loudly enough that your father mentioned it." A hint of a smile. "He said you talked to yourself for an hour last night, listing names and then explaining, in detail, why each one was wrong."

Morn felt heat rise to his face. "The walls in our alcove are thin."

"The walls in our alcove have contained eighteen children over two centuries. They've heard worse." Galenna shifted to face him more directly. "Tell me what's troubling you. And don't say 'nothing'—I've known you since before you had words, and 'nothing' has never been in your vocabulary."

For a moment, Morn considered deflecting. It was easier to talk around things than through them, to build elaborate conversational structures that approached the truth without ever quite arriving. He was good at that. Everyone said so.

But this was his mother, who had named him Mornik before he'd drawn his first breath, who had introduced him to the Warren with the old words, who had listened to his endless questions for fifteen years without once telling him to simply be quiet.

"I don't know who I'm supposed to be," he said. The words came out smaller than he'd intended.

Galenna nodded slowly. "Go on."

"Everyone else seems to know. Torvak was always going to be an administrator—he chose 'Torvak' because it means 'steady hand,' and now he's got the steadiest hands in the Warren. Durvo chose 'Durvo' because it means 'one who wanders,' and he's been to thirty systems. Even Tessik knew at twelve that she wanted to be 'Tessik' because it sounds like the word for 'color' and she's spent her whole life painting."

"And you?"

"I'm just..." Morn spread his hands helplessly. "I'm just Morn. I talk too much. I listen to people. Sometimes I make them laugh. That's not a True Name. That's barely even a personality."

"Is talking and listening such a small thing?"

"Compared to Steady Hand and One Who Wanders? Yes."

Galenna was quiet for a moment. Above them, Persistent Vellix rustled in a faint breeze that had found its way down from the surface. Somewhere in the depths of the Warren, a child laughed—Tessanna, probably, who laughed at everything.

"Let me tell you about my True Name," Galenna said finally.

Morn blinked. His mother rarely talked about herself—there was always another child to discuss, another crisis to manage, another meal to prepare.

"When I was your age," she continued, "I was terrified of the choosing. My older sisters had all picked magnificent names—Vorenna, Kathrix, Bellanine. Names that sounded like they belonged to people who would do great things. And I couldn't think of anything that felt right."

"What did you do?"

"I panicked. And in my panic, I chose 'Galenna'—a variation of 'Galorum.' Our Warren name, barely modified." Her smile turned wry. "The elders said it showed 'admirable loyalty to family tradition.' My sisters said it showed I had no imagination."

"But you've always seemed so comfortable with it."

"Now, yes. But for years, I wondered if I'd made a mistake. If I should have been bolder. Claimed a bigger name, a braver name." She reached over and took Morn's hand—her fingers rough with work, warm with life. "And then I started having children. Eighteen of them, as it turned out. And I realized something."

"What?"

"That 'Galenna' wasn't a prediction of who I would be. It was a seed I planted and grew into. Every day, I chose what that name would mean. And I chose it to mean home. Safety. The place you all come back to." She squeezed his hand. "Names are not prophecies, Morn. They're not contracts. They're seeds. What matters is what you grow them into."

Morn stared at the struggling vine beside them, its leaves small but stubbornly green against the dim light.

"But what if I don't know what I want to grow?"

"Then you choose a seed that gives you room to find out." Galenna released his hand and reached into her pocket, withdrawing something small and worn—a piece of stone, carved with letters so faded they were nearly illegible. "Do you know what 'Mornik' means?"

"It was just a birth name. They don't mean anything."

"They all mean something. I chose it from an old dialect, nearly forgotten now." She pressed the stone into his palm. "Mornik means 'one who asks.'"

Morn looked down at the carved letters. The stone was warm from his mother's pocket, smooth from years of handling.

"One who asks," he repeated.

"You came into this world asking questions. You asked about everything—the lights, the stones, the faces above your crib. Your first word wasn't 'mother' or 'food.' It was 'why.'" Galenna's eyes glistened. "And you've never stopped. You ask people about their lives, their hopes, their sorrows. You ask until they tell you things they've never told anyone else. That's not nothing, Morn. That's a gift."

"But is it enough for a True Name?"

"Only you can answer that." She stood, brushing dust from her clothing. "But consider this: perhaps you've already found your name. Perhaps 'Morn' is simply 'Mornik' grown up. The one who asks, shortened by time and use, worn smooth like the stones in the Hall of Names." She smiled down at him. "Something to think about."

She left him there, beside Persistent Vellix, holding a piece of ancient stone with his birth name carved upon it.

That night, in his alcove, Morn lay awake and stared at the ceiling.

He had a list, of course. He always had a list. Names he'd considered, elaborated upon, and ultimately rejected:

MORNAXIS THE ELOQUENT—too pretentious, and besides, "eloquent" implied speaking well, not just speaking *often*.

THORNVEL—sounded brave and noble, but Morn had never been particularly brave and wasn't sure he wanted to commit to trying.

KASSINDOR—aesthetically pleasing but meant "swift runner," which was actively false advertising given his relationship with physical exertion.

BELGAMORN—an attempt to build on his birth name, but it sounded like a digestive ailment.

SIMPLE MORN—following the tradition of SIMPLE TARN, but somehow when he imagined introducing himself that way, he just felt sad.

He turned the stone over in his fingers, feeling the worn letters. One who asks.

Maybe that was the problem. Maybe he was so busy asking questions about his name that he'd overlooked the answer that had been there all along. Maybe "Morn" wasn't a shortcut or a lack of imagination. Maybe it was just... him. Complete. Enough.

Or maybe he was fooling himself, and he'd wake up tomorrow just as uncertain as before.

He rehearsed the grand names one more time, letting them roll through his mind like ships passing through space:

*Thessendrix. Korvenmorn. Ballistor the Bright.*

None of them fit. None of them would ever fit.

But when he finally drifted to sleep, it was with his mother's words echoing in his ears, and the old stone clutched in his palm, and a single syllable resting quietly in his chest like something small and stubborn and growing:

*Morn.*

Just Morn.

Perhaps that would have to be enough.
