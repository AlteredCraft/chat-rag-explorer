# Chapter 11: The Lonely Hauler

The *Patient Ear* hummed through the void between Tellar Prime and the Rigel system, a journey of seventeen days at her comfortable cruising speed. Morn had made this run before—knew every dead spot where subspace communications faded to static, every waypoint where the stars shifted from familiar to foreign. He knew the route the way he knew the worn patches on his command chair, the slight list to port when the inertial dampeners cycled through their maintenance routine, the exact temperature at which the recycled air carried a faint metallic taste.

Twenty years. He had spent twenty years in this ship, and she had become an extension of his body. He could feel her reactor pulse like a second heartbeat.

"Computer," Morn said, his voice filling the cockpit, "what's our estimated arrival time at Waypoint Seven?"

The computer chirped. A display updated. No voice responded—the *Patient Ear* was a working vessel, not a luxury liner, and her systems communicated in beeps and readouts rather than synthesized speech.

"Right," Morn said. "Forty-seven hours. That's what I thought."

He leaned back in his chair and watched the stars stream past. Lurians were not built for silence. Their ears, those magnificent sensory organs that had evolved in the echoing caverns of homeworld warrens, craved input. Sound was how Lurians knew they were not alone. Sound was safety. Sound was home.

Out here, the only sound was Morn's own voice.

"You know what Mother used to say," he continued, addressing the empty co-pilot's seat. "She used to say that a Lurian who stops talking has stopped living. That words are how we breathe. That silence is just—" He made a gesture with his thick fingers. "Suffocation in slow motion."

The co-pilot's seat did not respond. It had never responded. In two decades, Morn had never taken on a partner or hired crew. The *Patient Ear* was rated for a complement of three, but Morn had converted the crew quarters into additional cargo space years ago. More efficient that way. More profitable.

More lonely.

"I'm not suffocating," he said firmly. "I'm fine. This is fine."

He stood and began his afternoon routine: checking cargo seals, running diagnostic sequences, preparing his evening meal. As he worked, he talked. He narrated each action, offered commentary on his own technique, debated with himself about whether to have the Bolian-style protein mash or the Terran pasta substitute for dinner.

"The pasta," he decided aloud. "Definitely the pasta. Although the mash has better nutritional density, and I've been neglecting my mineral intake, but then again I had the mash yesterday, and variety is—"

He stopped. Stood in the middle of his small galley with a sealed meal packet in each hand.

"Computer, how long since my last real conversation? Not counting automated responses from station systems."

The computer chirped. It did not understand the question.

"Never mind." Morn chose the pasta, tore open the packet, and ate standing up at the narrow counter. "It was Korvan Station. That Denobulan cargo inspector. Friendly fellow. Talked about his children for twenty minutes." He chewed thoughtfully. "That was eleven days ago."

Eleven days. Nearly two weeks since he had heard another voice, felt the rhythm of genuine dialogue, experienced the particular joy of a conversation that went somewhere unexpected.

Lurians could go long periods alone—they were adaptable, as all successful species must be. But they were not meant for it. The Warren existed because Lurians needed community the way other species needed oxygen. Even the most independent Lurian, even someone like Morn who had chosen the stars over the caverns, still felt the pull. The ache.

After dinner, he settled into what he privately called his "evening broadcast"—a habit he had developed in his first year of solo hauling and never managed to break.

"Personal log," he said, settling into a cushioned alcove that served as his sleeping quarters. "Stardate... ah, who's counting. Day five of the Rigel run. All systems nominal. Cargo secure. Weather in space remains predictably void-like."

He chuckled at his own joke. No one else would ever hear it.

"Talked to Mother's grave-marker today. Well, talked *about* her. She's been dead for twelve years now, but I still hear her voice sometimes. Usually when I'm about to do something inadvisable." He paused. "Which she would probably point out means I hear her voice quite often."

The alcove was small enough that he could touch both walls if he stretched out his arms. Some species would have found it claustrophobic. To a Lurian, it was almost cozy—reminiscent of the sleeping niches in Warren chambers, where families would cluster together in the warm dark.

Almost.

"I've been thinking about Lira," Morn continued. "My youngest sister. She sent a message last month—standard family update, nothing urgent. Three of her children have completed their education now. The eldest is working in the atmospheric processors. Lira says she has my nose." He touched his own substantial nasal ridge. "Poor child."

He had meant to respond to that message. Had drafted a reply in his head a dozen times, full of questions about his nieces and nephews, anecdotes from his travels, assurances that he was doing well. But somehow the words never made it from his thoughts to the communication system. Somehow days became weeks became a month.

"What would I even say?" He shifted on the narrow cushion. "Hello, family. Still out here. Still alone. Still—"

He stopped. Swallowed.

"Computer, end log."

The computer chirped acknowledgment. The recording stopped, joining hundreds of others in the *Patient Ear's* memory banks. Morn had never listened to any of them. Never deleted them either. They existed in a kind of limbo, proof that he still had words even when there was no one to receive them.

---

Waypoint Seven was a refueling station that catered to independent haulers—a cluster of docking ports around a central hub, minimal staff, competitive rates on deuterium and antimatter. Morn had stopped here perhaps thirty times over the years. He knew the layout, the procedures, the particular quirks of their docking clamps.

He did not expect to find company.

"Mind if I sit?"

Morn looked up from his meal—the station's version of Andorian takeout, which bore only passing resemblance to actual Andorian cuisine—to find a human woman standing beside his table. She was older, her dark hair streaked with gray, her face lined in ways that suggested years of hard work and harder decisions. She wore the practical coverall of a working pilot, and she carried her own tray of dubious station food.

"Please," Morn said, gesturing to the empty seat across from him. "I'd welcome the company."

The woman sat. "Janet Okonkwo. I run the *Second Wind* out of Alpha Centauri."

"Morn. The *Patient Ear*. No particular homeport."

"A wanderer." Janet nodded as if this confirmed something. "I can always spot them. There's a look."

"What kind of look?"

"Hungry." She took a bite of her meal, grimaced, took another bite anyway. "Not for food. For—" She waved her fork vaguely. "This. Sitting. Talking. Being seen."

Morn felt a flush of something he couldn't quite name. Embarrassment, perhaps, at being so easily read. Or relief at being read at all.

"You're not wrong," he admitted. "I've been in transit for twelve days. You're the first person I've spoken to since Korvan Station."

"Twelve days." Janet whistled softly. "That's a long silence. How long have you been solo hauling?"

"Twenty years."

She set down her fork. Studied him with eyes that had clearly seen too much. "Twenty years alone?"

"Not entirely alone. I take contracts, I interact with clients, I have family back on Luria who—" He stopped, because Janet was shaking her head slowly.

"That's not the same thing and you know it." She picked up her fork again, speared something that might have been a vegetable. "I did fifteen years solo before I couldn't take it anymore. Hired a co-pilot. Young kid from Mars Colony, talked too much, got on my nerves every single day." A small smile. "Best decision I ever made."

"You're not solo anymore?"

"She's off visiting family while I make this run. Even now, I couldn't do more than a few weeks alone." Janet leaned back, regarding him with something that might have been concern. "You're Lurian. Your people are... social, right? Pack species?"

"Warren species," Morn corrected automatically. "We live in large family groups. Communal chambers. Shared everything." He could still remember the sound of it—the constant murmur of voices, the echo of footsteps, the way you were never truly alone even in sleep.

"And you've been flying solo for twenty years."

"It was a choice." Even to his own ears, the words sounded defensive. "I wanted freedom. Independence. To see the galaxy on my own terms."

"Uh huh." Janet chewed thoughtfully. "And how's that working out?"

Morn opened his mouth to answer—to deliver the practiced response about the satisfactions of independent work, the beauty of the open stars, the pride of building a reputation through skill alone. The words were right there, ready to deploy.

Instead, he heard himself say: "I talk to empty chairs. I record logs that no one will hear. I rehearse conversations with my siblings because I've forgotten how to actually talk *to* them." He blinked, surprised by his own honesty. "I am, perhaps, not as fine as I pretend to be."

Janet nodded as if this, too, was expected. "Solo hauling is a young person's game," she said gently. "When you're young, you've got enough fire in you to keep the silence at bay. But eventually—" She shrugged. "Eventually, you need a crew. Or a home base. Somewhere you belong."

"And if you don't have either?"

"Then you find them." She finished her meal, pushed the tray aside. "You seem like a decent sort, Morn. Don't let the void swallow you. It's patient, and it's always hungry."

They talked for another hour—about routes and cargo, about the changing economics of independent freight, about nothing in particular. It was, Morn realized, the most normal conversation he'd had in years. Not a business transaction. Not a family obligation. Just two people sharing time and words because they wanted to.

When Janet finally stood to leave, she paused. "You got people reaching out to you? Trying to connect?"

Morn thought of the messages in his communication queue. The periodic attempts from old acquaintances. The latest from Hain, received three days ago and still unanswered.

"Yes," he admitted. "A few."

"Answer them." Janet picked up her tray. "Trust me. Whatever's keeping you from responding? It's not worth it."

She walked away. Morn sat alone at the table, surrounded by the quiet bustle of the refueling station, and thought about all the messages he'd left unread. All the connections he'd let wither. All the words he'd spoken to empty rooms when there were people—real people—who wanted to hear him.

---

The *Patient Ear* slipped back into the void, her cargo holds full of fresh fuel, her pilot sitting alone in the cockpit. Morn watched the refueling station shrink to a point of light, then vanish entirely.

"Computer," he said, "retrieve message queue. Display all communications from—" He paused. Swallowed. "From Hain."

The display populated with a list. Twelve messages over five years. The most recent was titled simply: *Thinking of you*.

Morn read it slowly. It was brief—Hain had always been economical with words, perhaps compensating for Morn's abundance of them. A job opportunity on Gallos IV. A chance to work together again. Nothing urgent, nothing demanding. Just an invitation, extended without expectation.

*I know you like your independence*, Hain had written. *But if you ever want company, there's a place for you here.*

Morn's finger hovered over the delete option. It would be so easy. He had deleted messages before, had convinced himself that silence was simpler than commitment.

But Janet's words echoed in his head. *Solo hauling is a young person's game*. And he was not young anymore. Seventy-five years old, more than half his expected lifespan, and what did he have to show for it? A reliable ship. A solid reputation. And a loneliness so profound that he talked to empty chairs just to hear the rhythm of dialogue.

"Computer," he said. "Begin recording. New message."

The computer chirped readiness.

"Hain." Morn's voice was steadier than he'd expected. "It's been too long since I responded. I know. I don't have a good excuse—I just—" He faltered. Started again. "I've been thinking about what you said. About finding a crew. About not doing everything alone."

He watched the stars stream past, ancient and indifferent.

"I'm not promising anything. I'm not good at promising things. But I'm—" The word caught in his throat. He forced it out. "I'm interested. In hearing more. In maybe... being part of something again."

He closed his eyes, feeling the hum of the ship around him, the vast silence of space pressing in from all sides.

"I'm tired, Hain. I didn't realize how tired until just now. And I think—" A long breath. "I think I'd like to stop being so tired."

He opened his eyes. "End recording. Send."

The computer chirped. The message vanished into subspace, carrying Morn's words across the light-years to someone who wanted to receive them.

He sat in his cockpit, alone as always, and yet somehow less alone than he had felt in years. The silence of the *Patient Ear* pressed in around him, but for the first time in a long time, it did not feel like suffocation.

It felt like anticipation.
