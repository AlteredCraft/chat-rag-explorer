# Chapter 6: First Molt

## BEFORE

The stories started three days before the fever did.

Morn sat in the common chamber of Galorum Warren, surrounded by siblings who had already crossed the threshold he was approaching. Drennik, barely four years Molted, had taken it upon himself to serve as primary tormentor. He lounged against a cushion pile with the practiced ease of someone who had recently discovered what ease felt like.

"The itching is the worst part," Drennik said, scratching his own arm for emphasis. "You'll want to tear your skin off with your own fingers. And the thing is—you can't. You have to wait for it to split on its own."

"I've heard it described as wearing a suit that's three sizes too small," Verrik added. He was only a year past Morn in age, but he'd Molted early, beating Morn to adulthood by nearly two years. "Every movement feels wrong. Like your body doesn't fit anymore."

"Because it doesn't," Drennik said. "That's the whole point. The old you doesn't fit. So you shed it."

Morn shifted on his cushion. He could feel it already—the tightness at his joints, the strange sensitivity along his spine. The healers had confirmed it yesterday. His First Molt would begin within the week.

Torvin, visiting from Kelleth Warren where he'd relocated after his own bonding ceremony, leaned forward with the gleeful expression of an older brother who had waited decades for this moment. "Nobody's mentioned the dreams yet."

"The dreams," several voices repeated in unison, a chorus of theatrical dread.

"What dreams?" Morn asked, immediately regretting it.

"Oh, he doesn't know about the dreams." Torvin shook his head slowly. "Should we tell him about the dreams?"

"We shouldn't," Drennik said. "It's better if he experiences them fresh."

"That seems cruel."

"It's tradition."

Morn looked between his siblings. Prenna, the eldest present at forty-two, sat slightly apart from the group, her expression unreadable. She hadn't contributed to the teasing yet, which either meant she disapproved or was saving something particularly devastating for the finale.

"Fine," Torvin continued, ignoring Drennik's protest. "The dreams. When the fever peaks—usually around day six or seven—you start seeing things. Hearing things. The ancestors come to visit."

"That's a myth," Verrik said.

"It's not a myth. I spoke with Great-Grandfather Korvath for an entire night. He told me things about the family that I couldn't possibly have known."

"Things your grandmother had already told you and you'd forgotten," Prenna finally spoke, her voice dry. "The fever dreams are just dreams, Morn. Your mind processing the changes."

"Prenna takes all the mystery out of everything," Drennik complained.

"Someone has to, or he'll go into the chamber expecting to commune with the dead and emerge disappointed."

Morn appreciated her intervention, but the tightness in his chest didn't ease. Dreams he could handle. The itching, the confinement, the physical discomfort—all of that fell within the realm of the endurable. What frightened him was less tangible.

Everyone who Molted came out different. Not just physically, though that was dramatic enough. The adult skin was thicker, the coloring deeper, the texture changed. But something else shifted too. Something internal. The kelvu, dormant through childhood, finally woke up. And with it came hungers that children didn't feel.

Ambition. Drive. The need to matter beyond the warren.

Morn had watched his siblings emerge from their Molts and become, somehow, more themselves. Drennik had always been restless, but post-Molt he'd channeled that restlessness into trading expeditions that kept him away from home for months at a time. Verrik had grown into his studiousness, becoming a keeper of warren histories. Prenna's natural authority had crystallized into genuine leadership.

What would Morn become? He'd spent thirty years as the quiet one, the observer, the Lurian who could disappear into the background of any gathering. Would the Molt amplify that tendency until he vanished entirely? Or would it reveal some hidden capacity he'd never suspected?

He wasn't sure which possibility frightened him more.

The teasing continued for another hour before the gathering dispersed. Morn lingered, helping to stack cushions and clear away the meal remnants that had accumulated during the conversation. Prenna lingered too, which he suspected was not a coincidence.

"Walk with me," she said, once they were alone.

They moved through the warren's corridors in comfortable silence. Galorum Warren was ancient, its tunnels carved deep into the living rock of Luria II, expanded and refined across countless generations. Morn knew every passage, every chamber, every carved relief depicting family history along the walls. In eleven days, he would see it all with new eyes.

Prenna led him to a small alcove overlooking one of the underground springs that provided the warren's water. The bioluminescent moss that grew along the water's edge cast everything in soft blue-green light.

"They exaggerate," Prenna said finally. "Torvin especially. He's been dining out on his Molt stories for twelve years now, and they grow more dramatic with each telling."

"I know."

"The itching is real, but manageable. The fever is uncomfortable, but our bodies are designed for it. The isolation feels endless while you're in it, but eleven days passes." She paused. "The dreams... those are harder to explain."

Morn waited.

"You won't commune with ancestors. That's superstition, and you're too practical to believe it anyway. But you will dream. Vividly, intensely, in ways that feel more real than waking. Your mind will be processing thirty years of experience while your body rebuilds itself. Things you've forgotten will surface. Things you've avoided will demand attention." She turned to look at him directly. "It's not dangerous. But it can be uncomfortable in ways that have nothing to do with the physical changes."

"You're not making me feel better."

"I'm not trying to make you feel better. I'm trying to prepare you." Prenna's expression softened slightly. "You've always been the watcher, Morn. The one who sees everything and says little. The Molt won't change that—not really. But it will... clarify things. You'll emerge knowing more about what you want. What you need. What you're willing to do to get it."

"And if I don't like what I learn?"

"Then you'll learn that too." She placed a hand on his shoulder. "You'll be fine. You've always been fine, even when you didn't believe it. The Molt just makes you see yourself more clearly. And I've never worried about what you'd see."

Three days later, when the fever finally came, Morn carried her words into the isolation chamber like a talisman.

## DURING

The chamber was small. Stone walls. A sleeping platform. A basin of water that someone replaced each morning while he drifted in and out of consciousness. Light that shifted from dim to dimmer to absent entirely, though he lost track of whether that was real or imagined.

Day one: the itching began.

It started along his spine, right where his shoulder blades met, and spread outward like a slow wave. His skin felt too tight, too thin, too present. Every brush of fabric against it sent signals his brain couldn't quite interpret. Pain, but not quite. Discomfort, but more. His nerves were recalibrating.

Day two: the splitting started.

He felt it before he saw it—a sensation of release along his back, like a seam coming undone. When he reached around to touch it, his fingers found the edge of his old skin, curling away from something newer underneath. The new skin was tender, hypersensitive, raw. He learned quickly not to touch it.

Day three: the fever truly arrived.

His temperature climbed. His thoughts grew thick, soupy, hard to hold onto. He drank water when he remembered to. He slept in strange intervals that might have been minutes or hours. The chamber's dimensions seemed to shift when he wasn't looking directly at them.

Day four: he stopped counting days.

---

Time moved like honey, slow and golden and impossible to track.

Morn lay on the sleeping platform, or maybe floated above it, or maybe had become it. The distinction seemed unimportant. His old skin continued its gradual separation, peeling away in sheets and strips and fragments that piled around him like shed leaves. Beneath it, the new skin emerged: darker, thicker, still forming its final texture.

Someone came and went. Brought water. Removed the old skin. He heard voices but couldn't parse their words. Maybe they weren't words. Maybe they were just sounds that his fever-addled brain tried to organize into meaning.

The ancestors arrived on what might have been day six.

They weren't really there—Morn understood that, even in the depths of the fever dream. But they felt real enough. Great-Grandmother Pellath sat in a corner that hadn't existed before, her form flickering like candlelight, telling him stories about the warren's founding that he'd heard a hundred times and never heard at all. Great-Uncle Vormen stood by the water basin, describing trade routes to systems Morn had never visited, his voice a low rumble that vibrated in Morn's new skin.

"You're not really here," Morn told them, or tried to. His voice came out strange—too deep, too resonant, changed.

"Of course not," Pellath agreed. "You're here. We're just what you've carried with you."

"That doesn't make sense."

"Very little makes sense during the Molt. That's rather the point."

The ancestors cycled through his chamber over the timeless hours that followed. Some offered wisdom. Some offered criticism. Some simply sat with him, silent company through the long nights that might have been days. Morn listened to all of them, argued with some of them, wept for reasons he couldn't articulate.

Somewhere around day eight, the kelvu woke up.

It felt like a second heart learning to beat. A hollow space in his abdomen that he'd always known existed but had never truly felt now announced itself with sudden, unmistakable presence. The secondary stomach, dormant through childhood, reached its adult functionality.

But that was the clinical description. What Morn actually experienced was stranger.

He became aware of a hunger that wasn't hunger. A need that food couldn't satisfy. His kelvu didn't want sustenance—it wanted more. More experience. More connection. More story.

The realization unfurled slowly through his fever-muddled thoughts. Every Lurian who Molted described the kelvu awakening differently because every Lurian wanted different things. For some, it manifested as ambition. For others, wanderlust. For Morn, lying in his isolation chamber while his old self peeled away, it felt like an expansion of the capacity he'd always had.

He wanted to listen. To understand. To collect the stories of everyone he met and hold them safe inside himself.

The ancestors in his fever dreams nodded their approval, or maybe that was just the fever breaking.

Day nine: clarity began to return.

The fever receded like tide water, leaving Morn stranded on the shore of his new body. He could see the chamber clearly now—just a small stone room, nothing more. No flickering ancestors. No shifting dimensions. Just walls and water and the pile of shed skin waiting to be cleared away.

His thoughts reorganized themselves into coherent patterns. He remembered who he was, where he was, why he was here. The dreams lingered at the edges of his consciousness, already fading into that strange category of experience that couldn't quite be classified as real or unreal.

Day ten: he could move without pain.

The new skin had finished forming. It felt different under his hands—thicker, less sensitive, more resilient. The coloring had deepened, though he wouldn't see the full change until he looked in a proper mirror. He ate solid food for the first time in over a week, his kelvu processing it alongside his primary stomach in a new internal harmony that felt completely natural and utterly strange.

Day eleven: the door opened.

Prenna stood in the corridor, her expression carefully neutral. "How do you feel?"

Morn considered the question seriously. His body felt unfamiliar, like a room he'd lived in for years that someone had rearranged while he slept. His mind felt clearer than he could ever remember it being, every thought sharp-edged and precise. His kelvu hummed with a quiet satisfaction, as though it had been waiting his entire life to finally wake up.

"Different," he said. His voice had changed—deeper, with more resonance. "But still me."

Prenna nodded, unsurprised. "Good. The family is gathering. The ceremony begins at sunset."

## AFTER

The great hall of Galorum Warren had been transformed.

Bioluminescent lanterns hung from the carved ceiling, their light supplementing the natural glow of the moss-covered walls. The long tables had been arranged in a wide semicircle, creating an open space at the chamber's center. Every adult member of the family who could attend had gathered—dozens of Lurians whose names and faces and stories Morn had known his entire life.

Galenna sat at the head of the arrangement, her ancient frame supported by cushions, her eyes sharp despite her two hundred sixty-five years. She had overseen Molts for longer than most of the family had been alive. She would oversee this one too.

Morn entered the hall on unsteady legs. His new skin felt conspicuous under everyone's gaze. He knew he looked different—the mirror in the preparation chamber had confirmed it. The same face, more or less, but somehow more defined. The same body, but carrying itself with a weight it hadn't possessed before.

The gathered family watched him approach the center of the semicircle. No one spoke. The ceremony required silence until the proper moment.

He reached the designated spot and stood, waiting.

Galenna raised one hand, the signal for the ceremony to begin. Around the semicircle, every adult who had Molted before him turned to face him fully.

And then, one by one, they asked the question.

"What name do you carry into adulthood?" Torvin was first, his voice formal in a way his teasing never was.

"What name do you carry into adulthood?" Prenna followed, her expression warm.

"What name do you carry into adulthood?" Drennik, then Verrik, then cousins and aunts and uncles and distant relations whose precise connections required genealogical charts to trace.

The question repeated, voice after voice, until it became a rhythm, a pulse, a tide of inquiry that washed over Morn and demanded a response.

He had prepared an answer. Galorum the Steady II—named for a great-great-uncle whose quiet reliability had been legendary. It was a traditional choice, appropriate for someone of his temperament. It would honor the family while acknowledging his own nature. No one would question it.

But as the final voice fell silent and the hall waited for his response, Morn found that the prepared answer wouldn't come.

The kelvu in his belly stirred. His new skin prickled with awareness. Thirty years of being "Morn" rose up in his throat, refusing to be renamed.

He had been Galorum-Morn-Krett since birth, his given name a compound reflecting family, individual, and tradition. But no one had ever called him Galorum. No one had ever called him Krett. Since he could form words, he had been Morn. Simply, entirely, completely Morn.

Why pretend otherwise now?

"Morn," he said.

The single syllable dropped into the silent hall like a stone into still water. Ripples of murmured reaction spread outward. It was an unusual choice—keeping the shortened birth name rather than selecting something new. Not unprecedented, but unusual. The True Name ceremony was supposed to be an opportunity for transformation, for declaring the adult self distinct from the child who had entered the Molt.

But Morn had spent eleven days shedding his old skin while his mind processed everything he had been and would become. He had listened to ancestors who weren't really there tell him stories he already knew. He had felt his kelvu wake up and recognize a hunger that had always existed, even before it had a name.

And he had emerged knowing exactly who he was.

He was Morn. He had always been Morn. The Molt hadn't changed that; it had only clarified it.

Galenna's voice cut through the murmuring. "The name is given. The name is witnessed. Morn stands among us as an adult of Galorum Warren."

The formal words ended the ceremony. Around the semicircle, faces shifted from surprise to acceptance to celebration. Whatever questions Morn's unconventional choice might raise could wait for later discussion. For now, tradition demanded that the family welcome their newest adult member.

Prenna reached him first, pulling him into an embrace that communicated approval without words. Drennik was close behind, all teasing abandoned in favor of genuine welcome. The family surrounded him, a tide of congratulations and well-wishes and assessments of how his new skin looked.

Through the crowd, Morn caught Galenna's eye. The family matriarch had not risen from her seat—at her age, that would have been remarkable—but she watched him with an expression he had never seen directed at him before.

Approval. Recognition. The look of someone who understood exactly what his choice had meant.

He had kept his name. The simple name. The name that reduced his formal birth designation to its essential core, just as he had always reduced complex situations to their essential truths.

He was Morn. He was thirty years old. He was an adult.

And somewhere deep in his newly-awakened kelvu, he felt the first stirrings of a hunger that would eventually carry him far from the warrens of Luria II, out into a galaxy full of stories waiting to be heard.

But that was later. For now, he stood in the great hall of his family home, surrounded by people who had known him since birth, and let himself simply be present.

He was Morn. It was enough.
