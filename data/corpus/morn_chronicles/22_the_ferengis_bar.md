# Chapter 22: The Ferengi's Bar

The seat at the end of the bar had a slight depression worn into it. Not enough that anyone would notice—not consciously—but enough that when Morn settled onto it, his weight found familiar grooves. The stool had molded itself to him, or perhaps he had molded himself to it. Either way, the fit was perfect.

"You're early," Quark said without looking up from the glasses he was polishing. "I haven't even finished watering down the kanar."

Morn made a sound that might have been amusement.

"Don't give me that look. The Cardassians expect their kanar to taste like industrial solvent. I'm doing them a favor by making it drinkable." Quark held a glass up to the light, checking for spots. "Besides, profit margin on pure kanar is barely worth the trouble. This way, everybody wins."

The logic was pure Ferengi—self-serving, rationalized, and delivered with complete confidence. Morn had heard variations of it for nearly two years now. He'd stopped questioning it around month three.

Quark set down a drink without being asked. The right temperature, the right glass, the right amount. He'd learned Morn's preferences early and had never forgotten them. "Same old crowd tonight," Quark continued. "Gul Evek's officers in the back, spending just enough to justify taking up space. The Bajoran cleaning crews in the corner, nursing their drinks because it's all they can afford. And you."

Morn lifted his glass in acknowledgment.

"You know what I appreciate about you?" Quark leaned against the bar, his voice dropping to something almost confidential. "You don't complain. Everyone else in this place has complaints. The Cardassians complain about the Bajorans. The Bajorans complain about the Cardassians. My suppliers complain about payments. My customers complain about prices. My brother complains about everything." He gestured expansively. "But you? You just sit there. Drink your drink. Listen to whatever I have to say. Never a word of criticism."

Morn inclined his head slightly.

"It's refreshing, is what it is. In a galaxy full of noise, you're a island of silence." Quark paused, perhaps realizing he'd come dangerously close to paying a compliment. "Of course, you could stand to order a second drink occasionally. Revenue is revenue."

Morn signaled for another round.

The truth was, Morn had chosen this seat—this bar, this station, this life—for reasons he couldn't quite articulate, even to himself. The running had stopped somewhere between his third month on Terok Nor and his hundredth drink at Quark's establishment. He'd simply... settled. Like sediment at the bottom of a glass, finding its natural resting place.

The station was ugly. Cardassian architecture favored function over form, intimidation over comfort. The ore processing plants hummed constantly, a low vibration that worked its way into the bones. The air tasted recycled, slightly metallic, carrying traces of whatever had passed through the environmental systems that day.

But there was rhythm here. Patterns. The Cardassian shifts changed at predictable intervals. The Bajoran workers shuffled through their routines with the resigned efficiency of people who had learned to survive by being invisible. The merchants and traders came and went, bringing gossip and goods from across the sector. And at the center of it all, like a spider in a web made of latinum, sat Quark.

Morn had known many bartenders across his travels. The profession attracted a certain type: people who could listen without judging, who could keep secrets, who understood that sometimes a drink was just a drink and sometimes it was something more. But Quark was different. Quark didn't just tend bar—he orchestrated. Every conversation was an opportunity. Every customer was a potential mark. Every drink served was a data point in his endless calculations of profit and loss.

And yet.

Quark remembered that Morn's birthday had passed three weeks ago. He'd said nothing about it, done nothing obvious, but the drink that night had been slightly larger than usual. A rounding error, easily deniable. But Morn had noticed.

Quark noticed when Morn's shoulders carried tension from bad news, or when his silences shifted from comfortable to heavy. He noticed, and he adjusted. Talked more on the heavy days, filling the air with trivial complaints so Morn didn't have to fill it himself. Talked less on the peaceful days, letting the quiet stretch between them like a shared understanding.

Neither of them called it friendship. Friendship implied obligations, expectations, the kind of emotional entanglements that Ferengi supposedly disdained and that Morn had spent years avoiding. This was something else. Something that didn't need a name.

"My brother is an idiot," Quark announced one evening, three drinks into what was shaping up to be a long night. "A complete, unambiguous idiot. You know what he did? He gave credit. *Credit*, Morn. To a Bajoran laborer. Do you know what the default rate is on credit extended to Bajoran laborers under Cardassian occupation?"

Morn waited.

"It's not good, I'll tell you that much. And does he factor this into his calculations? Does he account for risk? No. He just sees a sad face and reaches for the latinum pouch." Quark threw his hands up. "I don't know where I went wrong with him. We had the same upbringing, the same education, the same opportunities. Yet here I am, building an empire, and there he is, giving away my profits to every hard-luck story that walks through the door."

The Ferengi's voice was sharp, but Morn heard the undertone. Worry, mostly. Rom was an idiot by Ferengi standards, which meant he possessed a certain kindness that didn't translate well into profit margins. Quark complained about him constantly, but he'd also given Rom a job. Given him a place. Kept him close where he could be protected, even if that protection was disguised as exploitation.

Family, Morn reflected, was complicated regardless of species.

"And then there's Nog," Quark continued. "My nephew. The boy has potential—good lobes, decent instincts—but he's being corrupted by Bajoran influences. Compassion. Fairness. *Honesty*." He pronounced the last word like it was a disease. "If I don't intervene, he'll grow up thinking that success comes from hard work and ethical behavior. Can you imagine?"

Morn made a sympathetic sound.

"Of course you can't. Because you're sensible. You understand how the universe actually works." Quark refilled Morn's glass, then poured one for himself—a rare indulgence. "The universe works on profit. Everything else is just... decoration."

He drank, and for a moment, the performance dropped. Just for a moment. Morn saw the exhaustion underneath, the weight of running a business in occupied territory, of navigating between Cardassian demands and Bajoran resentments and customers who all wanted something for nothing.

Then the moment passed, and Quark was Quark again. "Speaking of profit, I've got a business opportunity you might be interested in. Low risk, high reward, minimal ethical complications..."

Morn listened. He always listened. That was his gift, and perhaps his burden—the ability to absorb other people's words without judgment, without advice, without the need to respond. People told him things. They told him things they wouldn't tell anyone else, because telling Morn was almost like not telling anyone at all. He was a repository, a vault, a black hole where secrets went to rest.

Some of those secrets he'd already forgotten. Others he carried still, latinum in the chambers of his heart.

The trouble started, as trouble often did on Terok Nor, with a Cardassian who felt he hadn't been shown proper respect.

Gul Marratt was a minor functionary, the kind of officer who compensated for his lack of real power by exercising petty tyranny over anyone beneath him. He'd entered into a business arrangement with Quark—the details of which Morn had gleaned from overheard conversations—involving the acquisition and resale of certain Bajoran antiquities. The arrangement had been profitable for both parties until Marratt decided he deserved a larger share.

"He's threatening to shut me down," Quark said, his voice uncharacteristically quiet. The bar was empty—middle of the sleep cycle—and Quark had asked Morn to stay after closing. "Not officially, of course. Nothing that could be traced back to him. But he has connections in station security. A few words in the right ears, and suddenly my liquor license needs 'review.' My suppliers face 'customs delays.' My customers get 'randomly selected' for security screenings every time they try to enter."

Morn watched Quark pace behind the bar, his usual confidence replaced by something closer to fear.

"I've tried negotiating. Offered him a larger percentage. He doesn't want percentage—he wants everything. He wants to make an example of me." Quark stopped pacing, gripping the edge of the bar. "If I lose this place, Morn... this is everything. Everything I've built. Everything I've planned for."

The Ferengi looked smaller than usual. Diminished. For all his bluster about profit margins and business opportunities, Quark genuinely loved his bar. It was his home, his identity, his masterwork. Losing it would destroy something essential in him.

Morn thought about the latinum he carried. Thought about the contacts he still maintained, despite years of trying to disappear. Thought about the delicate balance of favors and obligations that constituted the gray market of the Alpha Quadrant.

He made a decision.

"I might know someone," he said.

Quark looked up, startled—perhaps by the words, perhaps by how many of them there were. "What?"

"Someone who does business with Cardassian officers. Someone who might be able to... adjust Gul Marratt's priorities."

"You—" Quark stared at him. "You have connections? *You*?"

Morn shrugged.

"But you're—" Quark gestured vaguely. "You just sit there. Every day. Drinking. I thought you were—" He stopped, reconsidering whatever assumptions he'd made. "Who are you?"

Another shrug. "Someone who knows someone."

---

Three days later, Gul Marratt's demands evaporated. A quiet word had been passed through certain channels—channels that existed outside official structures, that moved information and influence like water finding its level. Someone owed someone a favor. Debts were called in, new debts created. The balance shifted.

Marratt never bothered Quark again. In fact, he went out of his way to avoid the bar entirely, as if the very sight of it reminded him of vulnerabilities he preferred to forget.

"I don't know what you did," Quark said, setting down Morn's drink with unusual care. "I'm not going to ask. But..." He struggled with something, some internal conflict between Ferengi pragmatism and an emotion he probably couldn't name. "Thank you."

Morn nodded.

"I mean it." Quark's voice was rough. "Nobody does anything for free. So whatever I owe you—"

Morn held up a hand. *No debt.*

"That's not how this works. That's not how *anything* works." But Quark's protest lacked conviction. He stood there for a moment, looking at Morn as if seeing him for the first time. Then he shook his head and moved to serve another customer.

He never asked about Morn's connections again. Never probed, never pried, never tried to leverage the knowledge for his own purposes. It was, Morn realized, the closest thing to respect a Ferengi could show.

The news came on an ordinary evening, carried by traders who'd arrived from Bajor itself. The Cardassians were withdrawing. The occupation was ending.

Quark's reaction was immediate and theatrical. "The Federation? *The Federation?* Do you know what they do to honest businessmen? They regulate everything. Tariffs, trade agreements, ethical oversight—ethical oversight, Morn, can you imagine?—they'll bury me in bureaucracy. They'll turn this place into some kind of... recreational facility. Free drinks and philosophical discussions about the nature of existence."

The bar buzzed with anxious energy. Cardassian officers spoke in low, urgent tones. Bajoran workers seemed caught between hope and disbelief, afraid to trust that decades of suffering might actually be ending. Everyone was reacting, planning, panicking, celebrating.

"Maybe I should leave," Quark said, though he sounded like he was trying to convince himself. "Cut my losses. Find some nice Ferengi colony where profit is still respected. Or maybe the Gamma Quadrant—I hear there's opportunity in the Gamma Quadrant, if you're willing to take risks..."

He trailed off, looking around his bar—the one he'd built from nothing, the one he'd nearly lost, the one that had become something more than just a business venture.

"Then again," he said quietly, "I've put a lot of work into this place."

Morn watched the chaos unfold around him. Officers packing, workers whispering, merchants calculating new angles for new regimes. The station that had been his home for two years was about to become something else entirely. The Cardassians who had built it would leave, and the Federation—with their principles and their protocols and their unfailing optimism—would arrive.

Everything was about to change.

Morn thought about his seat at the bar, worn to the shape of his body. Thought about Quark, who complained constantly but who had saved that seat every night, who had noticed when Morn was troubled, who had let him exist without demanding explanation. Thought about the strange, unnameable thing that had grown between them—not friendship, not partnership, but something real nonetheless.

The station would change. The customers would change. The regulations and authorities and day-to-day rhythms would all change.

But this seat, at this bar, with this irritating, generous, complicated Ferengi—this felt like something worth keeping.

Morn raised his glass, catching Quark's attention.

"Another?" Quark asked, already reaching for the bottle.

Morn nodded.

The future could sort itself out. Tonight, he would drink.
