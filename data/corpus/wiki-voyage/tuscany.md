# Tuscany

Tuscany (Italian: Toscana) is a region on Italy's west coast, on the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is one of the most popular places to visit in a country that is itself one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. There are several reasons to visit Tuscany: some of the most important ones are seeing Renaissance art in Florence, eating Tuscan food and tasting the excellent local wines, and after all this enjoying a day at the beach in Viareggio.

## Other destinations

There are many hot springs in Tuscany, which have been prized since ancient Roman times, if not earlier.

## Understand
Tuscany has three very diverse faces; the art cities such as Florence, Siena, Lucca and Pisa, the countryside, and the coastal and islands region.
The small towns, villages, castles, villas and vineyards of Tuscany make a welcome change from the traffic and noise of some of the larger Tuscan cities.

### Tourist information

## Get in

### By plane
International flights commonly come in to Milan or Rome, where one can rent a car and do the three-hour drive to Tuscany.
Florence and Pisa have important airports. Every major city has a railway station.

1 Pisa International Airport (PSA IATA), 1.5km (1 mile) south of Pisa city centre.
2 Amerigo Vespucci International Airport (FLR IATA), four kilometres from the centre of Florence.
Delta Air Lines (US carrier) has a direct flight from New-York JFK to Pisa, offering a cheaper, alternative to flying into Florence.

### By train
Florence, Pisa, and Grosseto are important rail destinations. Florence has two major rail stations, Santa Maria Novella (SMN) in the city centre and Campo di Marte (CdM) a bit further away.
Connections to Florence from the rest of Italy by train are generally fast and frequent and EuroStar Italia services are available. For example, there are easy connections found from Milano, Orvieto, Rome, Bologna and Ravenna.
Night train services are available to Florence from Zurich, Munich, Siracusa, Salerno, and others.

## Get around

### By train
From the central station of Florence you can easily reach most places in Tuscany, including:

Siena (1.5 to 2 hours)
Pisa (1 to 1.5 hours)
San Gimignano (by train to Poggibonsi, 1 hour ride, and then a bus that runs every 30-40 minutes, 25-minute ride)
Volterra (also reachable by bus from Poggibonsi)
Lucca
Arezzo

### By bus
Mobilitá has a useful website  for bus routes and schedules in Tuscany. The site is mostly in Italian, but is simple to use. (The Tuscan bus companies Siena Mobilitá, Tiemme, and Toscana Mobilitá seem to be affiliated.)
Local services for several cities are marked urbano. The interurban services are all under the tab servizio extraurbano.
Google maps identify bus stops throughout Tuscany for both local and interurban routes. If you click on the bus stop symbol, you can get a list of bus routes serving that stop. Using Google Streetview, you can often identify which side of the road the stop is situated and hence which direction of travel is served by the stop.
Bus users should purchase their bus tickets before boarding the bus. Most Tabacchi-shops (tobacconists) sell bus tickets. Sometimes newsstands and bars may also sell tickets. You must tell the ticket seller your destination so that your ticket will be valid for the correct fare zones.  After boarding the bus, stamp your ticket in the machine located behind the driver.
Beware that many routes have either reduced or no service on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Schedules indicate reduced service as festivo while the regular work day schedule is feriale. Many bus stops have posted schedules.
Blue-coloured buses are for interurban service while orange-coloured buses are for local service. Interurban buses can serve local stops along the route.

## See

Tuscany is world-famous for its churches, including the Duomo and Baptistery, Santa Croce, Santa Maria Novella, San Miniato al Monte and several others in Florence; the Duomo and Baptistery in Siena; and the Duomo and Baptistery in Pisa.
Tuscany is also known for its great museums, especially the Uffizi in Florence but also the Bargello and Accademia, the Musei dell'Opera del Duomo in Florence and Siena, the museum in the Palazzo Pubblico and the Pinacoteca in Siena, and the Museo Archeologico in Arezzo, among many others.
The small town of San Gimignano deserves special mention because while none of its churches or museums are very large, it contains so much beauty in such a small area. The town of Pienza is itself practically a museum in the round, as its foremost claim to fame is its architecture. There are many other beautiful small towns with great art, including Cortona.
Which segues into the other great draw of a trip to Tuscany: The beauty of the countryside. In order to understand Tuscan painting, you need to see the Tuscan countryside, which except for the relatively recent introduction of sunflower cultivation is still similar to what you can see in paintings by great Gothic painters like Giotto (Florentine), Simone Martini and Duccio (Sienese).

### Parks

## Do

Besides wandering in beautiful cities and looking at Renaissance art, there are many other things you can do in Tuscany. For example, you can learn to cook or just taste Tuscan food, do trekking, golf or go to a health spa.

Most of the important traditional wine producers are located along the axis formed by Florence and Siena. The most famous region is Chianti along with neighboring Montalcino and Montepulciano. The white wines are less famous than the reds, but as an exception the Vernaccia of San Gimignano is recognized as a DOCG wine. The Tuscan wine industry has evolved a lot during the last 30-40 years, and the result is what is called Super Tuscan wine, famously produced in Bolgheri but also in Maremma and many other parts of Tuscany.
Tuscany offers great biking opportunities, especially the central part. The hills and small cities give a pleasant variation, but it is rather strenuous, as July and August can be very hot.

## Eat

Tuscan food is known for its relative simplicity and its reliance on the high-quality ingredients from its many farms.
A small selection of the rich regional Tuscan cuisine comprises:

ribollita — bread soup with vegetables
zuppa di verdure — green vegetable soup
pici — thick spaghetti
pasta e fagiolli — pasta with beans
bistecca alla fiorentina (Florentine steak)
prosciutto Toscano — a dry cured ham that legally can only be called such if it is produced in Tuscany using traditional methods. Unlike the better-known prosciutto di Parma and prosciutto di San Daniele, which are cured using only sea salt, prosciutto Toscano is cured using a special mixture of sea salt with various local spices, thus giving it a unique flavour.
desserts
panforte, a unique dense Sienese fruit and nut cake
cavallucci - Sienese Christmas cookies, made with almonds, candied fruit and also spices like anise and coriander that presumably date back to the time when Siena had a monopoly on trade with the East
ricciarelli - almond paste cookies, also a speciality of Siena
biscotti di Prato, also called cantuccini - the almond biscuits most travellers to Italy are already familiar with originated in the Tuscan town of Prato and are still manufactured there
In addition, Tuscany has its own traditional cheeses, including Pecorino Toscano, a much milder cheese than the better-known Pecorino Romano and a great accompaniment to prosciutto and melon or just to eat with fresh bread, and Pecorino di Pienza, perhaps an even better appreciated local sheep cheese.

## Drink

The question about what to drink in Tuscany is easy to answer. The region is famed for its wines, most notably the sangiovese reds Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and the white Vernaccia di San Gimignano. Of these, Chianti can be anything from inexpensive, drinkable plonk to, when it comes to the best examples of Chianti Classico, a world class wine. The wines of Montalcino and Montepulciano are generally of a high standard, and in particular Brunello regularly receives lots of awards (something reflected on the price as well). If you are not prepared to pay a fortune for your wine but would still like something a bit nicer, both Montalcino and Montepulciano have the common man's version of their wines, Rosso di Montalcino and Rosso di Montepulciano.
Of these traditional wines perhaps only Brunello has the power to accompany a big Florentine steak, bistecca alla fiorentina. For something fleshier, you have to turn to the Super Tuscan wines. These commonly use cabernet sauvignon to complement or to completely replace the traditional grapes. Famous examples are Sassicaia and Tignanello.

## Sleep

There are loads of hotels in the cities that are major tourist attractions, including Florence and Siena, and there are also plenty of agriturismo spots and villas in the countryside. If you are seeking less expensive accommodation, you are more likely to find it closer to railway stations in cities like Florence, but some other cities' railway stations are outside the city walls, and some major destinations such as San Gimignano don't have any railway station at all. You may also try your luck at local tourism agencies, which may have a list of relatively inexpensive accommodations, such as apartments for rent by the day or week and pieno pensioni (boarding houses that provide 3 meals a day).

## Go next
Umbria, to the east, shares Tuscany's rolling hills but is further inland and higher up; it is also less densely populated, and has an equally good but distinctive cuisine that features black truffles and mushrooms.
Lazio, to the south, was the heart of both ancient Rome and the Papal States, and though it, too, has beautiful countryside, it is above all the region of Rome.
Emilia-Romagna, to the north, is another region traditionally known for its great food (especially in Bologna) and rich in history, including the extraordinary and very well-preserved Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna.
Liguria, up the coast to the northwest, contains the Italian Riviera and the historic port city of Genoa.
The Marche, which shares a short, mountainous border with the eastern side of Tuscany, is a lesser-known region, but one that also has quite a long history including the hill city of Urbino and also features the spectacular Grotte di Frasassi (Frasassi Caves).
