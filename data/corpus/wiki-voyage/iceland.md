# Iceland

Iceland (Icelandic: Ísland) is a stunningly beautiful place if you enjoy strange and desolate landscapes interspersed with glaciers, volcanoes, rivers and waterfalls. It is a place for hiking, ice climbing, kayaking in glacial waters, and relaxing in geothermal hot springs, and there are many tours available for those looking for a less strenuous vacation.

## Regions

## Cities and towns
1 Reykjavík (REYG-ya-veeg) — the capital of Iceland and the largest city
2 Akureyri (Ahk-oo-rey-rih) — capital of the North and the largest town outside the Southwest
3 Egilsstaðir (AY-yill-stath-ihr) — main town in the East, has some of the best weather Iceland has to offer
4 Hafnarfjörður (HAP-nar-FYERTH-er)  — cozy town on the outskirts of the capital region
5 Höfn (HEP'n) — main town on the southeastern coast
6 Húsavík (HOOS-ah-veek) — one of the world's most reliable whale watching sites during the summer
7 Ísafjörður (EES-ah-FYERTH-er) — largest town of the Westfjords of Iceland
8 Selfoss (SEL-fos) — south Iceland's largest town, hub of the main agricultural region
9 Stykkishólmur (STICK-is-hole-mur) — main town on the Snæfellsnes peninsula, gateway to the islands of Breiðafjörður

## Other destinations

It's a shame most visitors don't stray far from the capital as some of the most memorable sights in Iceland are farther afield. There are many excursions offered by tour companies, readily available from any of the main centres such as Reykjavík and Akureyri. They will fly you around and take you out to the glaciers and to the big volcanoes for a reasonable price. However, the cheapest option is to drive around with a rental car since none of these sites have entry fees.

### National parks
1 Þingvellir National Park (pronounced "THING-vet-lihr") — A UNESCO World Heritage site. 30 to 50 km (19 to 31 mi) east of Reykjavík. Interesting for a number of reasons: it is the original site of the longest running parliament in the world (the name literally means 'parliamentary fields'), and it's where the North-American and European continental shelf plates are being torn apart.
2 Vatnajökull National Park (VAT-nah-yer-CUDDLE) — Iceland's newest national park is Europe's largest national park at 12,000 km2 (4,600 sq mi), covering about 12% of the surface of Iceland. The park is home to Iceland's highest mountain, Hvannadalshnúkur, largest glacier, Vatnajökull, the Jökulsárlón ice lagoon, and Europe's largest waterfall in terms of volume discharge, Dettifoss.
3 Snæfellsjökull National Park (SNY-fetls-yer-CUDDLE) — Located on the tip of the Snæfellsnes Peninsula in western Iceland, this park is home to the ice-covered volcanic crater that was the setting for Jules Verne's book Journey to the Center of the Earth.

### Other attractions
1 Blue Lagoon (Icelandic: Bláa Lónið) (BLAU-ah LONE-eeth) – famous outdoor pool and health centre. The spa is in Grindavík on the Reykjanes Peninsula, south-western Iceland. It is situated approximately 13 km (8 mi) from the Keflavík International Airport and 39 km (24 mi) from Reykjavík. This geothermal spa in the middle of a lava field with its milky blue water is quite surreal. The hot water is sourced from the outlet of the nearby geothermal plant which extracts most of the heat energy and reduces the superheated water to a temperature that humans enjoy.
2 Mývatn (MEE-fatn) — a lake region near Akureyri in the North of Iceland, Mývatn has an unearthly appearance owing to special types of volcanic craters throughout the lake. There are plenty of activities in this area: Smajfall (desert where sulphuric steam comes out of the ground) and Dimmuborgir (aka the Black City and the Gates of Hell).
3 Gullfoss — the Golden Falls. On the edge of the inhospitable Interior of Iceland about 100 km east of Reykjavík, the river Hvítá plunges down a double cascade to create what many people believe is the most beautiful waterfall in Iceland
4 Langjökull ("long glacier") — the country's second-largest glacier, sprawling across an impressive 935 km2 (361 sq mi) of the western highlands, is an expansive icy wilderness. Not far away, on the popular Golden Circle route, meltwater from Langjökull feeds into the Gullfoss waterfall, creating a cascade, and flows into the geysers in the Geysir hot springs area.
5 Geysir — geothermal hot spot located 10 km west of Gullfoss. Geysir itself (from which the English word "geyser" derives) is no longer reliably active, but fortunately Strokkur next door goes off every five to ten minutes.
6 Jökulsárlón (the Jökulsár Lagoon) — the majestic glacial lagoon in southeast Iceland located near Höfn on Route 1. Breiðamerkurjökull glacier retreated quickly from 1920 to 1965 leaving this breathtaking lagoon, which is up to 190 m deep. Ice breaks off from the glacier keeping the lagoon stocked with icebergs all year round.
7 Landmannalaugar — a region of outstanding natural beauty reachable by bus (or 4x4) from Reykjavík. Situated in the Interior, it gives a taste of the uninhabited highlands at Iceland’s core.
8 Reykholt — former home of Snorri Sturluson, a medieval poet, author and chieftain who is best known for compiling the Prose Edda, which is today considered the authoritative source for pre-Christian Norse mythology.
9 Thórsmörk (Thor's Mark) — tucked away between three glaciers, Þórsmörk is an incredibly beautiful and relatively isolated area. Icelanders enjoy camping there in the summer. There are many hiking trails all over the area, which provide breathtaking views of the surrounding glaciers and lava formations. It is accessible only by truck or bus: it is a good idea to enquire about trips to Þórsmörk at a tourist information centre.

## Understand

Iceland is an island nation in the North Atlantic Ocean. Iceland is one of the Nordic countries, and therefore culturally part of Europe.
Because it is so close to the Arctic Circle, the amount of daylight varies dramatically by season. The sun sets briefly each night in June, but it doesn't get fully dark before it comes back up again. It is a beautiful sight and one definitely not to be missed, but it can make it hard to sleep. It is easy to lose track of time when the sun is still high in the sky at 23:00 (the time zone amplifies this: wall clock time is 1–1½ hr ahead of sun time). In the March and September equinoxes, days and nights are of about equal length, as elsewhere in the world. If you go in December, it's almost 20 hours of darkness.
Summer is definitely the best time to go, even though that time can be more crowded. Early or late winter, however, can be surprisingly good times to visit. In late January, daylight is from about 10:00 to 16:00, prices are lower than in the high season, and the snow-blanketed landscape is eerily beautiful. Some sites are, however, inaccessible in the winter. No matter when you go though, the weather is never hot, though Icelanders bemoan their glaciers shrinking due to climate change. Be prepared for rainy days in fall, and for it to be windy everywhere during any season.
Icelanders are proud of their independence from external influences and strive for political neutrality. An exception to this is their NATO membership, and even there, they are the only nation in NATO which is not required to have a military contribution. Indeed, Iceland does not have a military. This streak of independence is also used to justify them not being a member of the European Union even though there are many voices within who advocate for this. Iceland is a member of the European Economic Area though – which allows for EU and other EEA citizens to freely immigrate to and work in Iceland.
Geothermal power is widely tapped for either power generation, or directly for the hot water that can be used for household heating or swimming pools, and spas. The abundance of geothermally heated swimming pool water has made swimming hugely popular. Most communities have a heated swimming pool and swimming as a sport is a required part of the school curriculum. People rarely swim at the beach because the water is cold, and the underwater currents often make for treacherous swimming.

Tourism information.

### History

Iceland is geologically a young land mass; it was formed 20 million years ago by volcanic eruptions on the mid-Atlantic ridge.
The first people to settle on Iceland were Vikings and sailors from Norway and Denmark. The first known settlement was Reykjavík, with remnants from AD 871. In AD 930 the settlers founded the Alþing, the world's oldest surviving parliament. Iceland was a bridgehead for Viking expeditions to Greenland and Newfoundland. The settlements that resulted from these expeditions became extinct, though.
In 1264 the parliament of Iceland made an agreement with the Norwegian king, to become his subjects in return for regular sailing to the island. Norway and Denmark were unified in the so-called Kalmar Union in the late 14th century. Iceland remained in the Kalmar Union until it was disbanded in 1814 and Denmark took control. In 1918, Iceland became a sovereign state within Denmark's realm. During the Second World War, one month after Germany's occupation of Denmark, British forces peacefully occupied Iceland. The United States took over the occupation in 1941, while they were still neutral in the war. In 1944, Iceland declared its independence from Denmark, and the Alþing again became a sovereign legislature.
Iceland had little immigration from the Viking Age until lately. The greatest single influx of foreigners was the Allied occupation during World War II, when British and American soldiers outnumbered Iceland's adult men. Many of them had families on Iceland. Since the 1990s, the EEA and Schengen agreements and later economic booms have resulted in a significant number of migrant workers, some of which have chosen to stay.
The economy of Iceland is mainly based on fisheries and aluminium smelters. Electricity and heating in Iceland come from hydroelectric power and geothermal plants.
Iceland had a booming bank sector in the early 2000s, which was hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis. Through austerity, devaluation and change of government, Iceland recovered from the recession, and is again one of Europe's strongest economies, with tourism now being a major pillar of Iceland's economy.

### People

Norse people were the first to settle Iceland in the 9th century AD. Tradition holds that the first permanent settler was Ingólfur Arnarson, a Norwegian Viking who made his home where Reykjavík now stands. It is thought that Irish monks had temporarily inhabited the island some years prior to this. Icelandic retains many features from Old Nordic at the time of first settlement and many Icelanders can retrace their lineage to one of the early settlers on at least one side.
Immigrants in Iceland now make up well over 10% of the population, giving Iceland a larger proportion of immigrants than Norway and Sweden. Tourism has steadily grown in the early 21st century, leading to a situation where in 2022, the number of tourists received during the year exceeded four times the local population. A lot of the tourism industry is supported by immigrants. Most immigrants are from Eastern Europe and South East Asia, and they typically speak English and little to no Icelandic. This has created friction amongst Icelanders, who feel like they should be able to go to restaurants (for example) and be able to use Icelandic rather than being forced to speak English.
For names, Icelanders use the old Norse patronymic system. This means that Icelanders typically have a last name of <father's name> prefixing "son" or "sen" if a male, and "dóttir" if a female. Thus the practice of women, after marriage, taking the last names of their spouse makes no sense in Iceland, and is not followed. A family of four – father, mother, son and daughter – will all have different last names. This is why Icelanders always address each other by their first name no matter how formal the situation. Their phone books are also ordered by first names, followed by the last names, with their occupations also listed for disambiguation purposes. In modern Iceland, it is not rare to use a matronymic for the last name instead – particularly in the case of single mothers, or fathers who do not want to be involved.

### Climate

Despite its name, Iceland has mild winters for a country at its latitude – owing to the warming effect of the Atlantic Gulf Stream – especially in comparison with the Russian climate. Coastal, south-western parts of Iceland enjoy a maritime temperate climate; its winters are often compared to those of the Pacific Northwest in the U.S.A., although the winter winds can be bitter. However, Iceland's rapidly changing weather has given rise to the local saying: 'If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes!' It's the kind of place where it's not unusual to get rained on and sunburned at the same time. Some Icelanders believe that if the winter is hard and long then the summer will be good and warm. The summers are usually cool and more temperate than elsewhere at the same latitude (the effect of the ocean again), averaging at 12°C (54°F). 20–25°C is considered quite warm.

### Holidays and festivals

Christmas follows the dates of the Western church. Stores are traditionally closed on Christmas Eve (24 December), Christmas day (25 December), New year's eve (31 December) and New year's day (1 January). The entire country, including all public transportation, restaurants (except a few in hotels), convenience stores and supermarkets, pretty much shuts down on those days.
Icelanders have 13 jule lads. Historically, the jule lads were pranksters who redeemed themselves by giving children presents. Each jule lad has its own day, with the first one coming to town on 12 December.
Epiphany (Icelandic: Þrettándinn) is celebrated with bonfires and firework displays. On this day, Icelanders play the roles of elves and hidden people.
Easter follows the dates of the Western church. Stores are traditionally closed on Good Friday (the Friday before Easter), Easter and Pentecost (49 days after Easter). The following days have Icelandic traditions:
Bolludagur — Held on a Monday, 7 weeks prior to Easter. A festival in which Icelanders eat puffed buns filled with jam and whipped cream. Traditionally, children are allowed to spank their parents before they leave their bed and are given a puffed bun instead.
Sprengidagur — Held on a Tuesday, 7 weeks prior to Easter. A festival during which Icelanders are expected to eat salted meat and yellow peas.
Öskudagur/Ash Wednesday — Held on a Wednesday, seven weeks prior to Easter. On this day, children dress in costumes and sing for candy. This is the Icelandic equivalent of the US Halloween.
Sjómannadagurinn (Seamen's day) is held on the first Sunday in June. A national holiday when Icelanders go to the nearest harbor to celebrate with seamen.
Þjóðhátíðardagurinn (Icelandic National day) is held on 17 June. Stores are traditionally closed on this day. The celebrations typically start with a parade and speeches, followed by less formal celebrations.
Verslunarmannahelgi (Workers weekend) is held on the first weekend of August. This is typically the largest holiday in Iceland. Shops are traditionally closed. Icelanders flock to outdoor festivals held across the country.

### Time zone
Iceland uses GMT (UTC±0), the same time zone as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal and parts of Spain. However, unlike those countries, Iceland does not observe Daylight Saving Time, making it the only country in Western Europe not to do so.

## Talk

The official language of Iceland is Icelandic (íslenska), which remains very similar to − although not quite the same as − 13th-century Norse (see Vikings and the Old Norse).
It is a Germanic language closely related to Faroese (with which it is mutually intelligible to some extent), Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, and more distantly to German, Dutch and English. Loanwords are shunned in Icelandic. For example, the word for computer is tölva, which literally means "number-prophetess". However, English speakers will still be able to recognise some cognates due to the common Germanic roots.

English is widely spoken by the locals and with the possible exception of the elderly, almost everyone you meet will be fluent in the language. You may be able to get around using only English, but attempts at speaking Icelandic are always appreciated and will most certainly endear you to the locals, since very few people actually make the effort to learn Icelandic.
Although all Icelanders learn Danish at school from a young age, proficiency in the language tends to be poor. Most Icelanders do not feel that Danish is a useful language to learn, and often opt to just speak English whenever they visit Denmark given the high level of English proficiency there. People engaged in Nordic cooperation may know the language well, and tend to pronounce it much more comprehensibly than native speakers.
Icelanders use the comma as decimal delimiter, i.e. 12,000 means 12, not twelve thousand, whereas 12 000 or 12.000 means twelve thousand. Icelanders use both the 24- and 12-hour system: the 24-hour system in writing and the 12-hour system in speech (without the AM/PM specifiers). In Icelandic, hálf tíu ("half ten") means half past nine (9:30). When speaking to a person not fluent in English it is best not to use the 24 hour system avoid misunderstanding. Dates can be seen abbreviated in a number of ways, but the order is always day-month-year, except when using the ISO 8601: 13/07/23, 13.7.23 and 130723 all mean 2023-07-13. Icelandic calendars also indicate the number of the week, 1 through 52.
Iceland uses the metric system only. There is limited knowledge of imperial or US measurements.
In Iceland there is no concept of a ground floor as in the UK. Instead, the entrance level of a building is called the first floor ("jarðhæð"), like in the US. Levels are then counted 1, 2, 3, etc.
Foreign television programmes and films are almost always shown in their original language with subtitles. Only children's programmes are dubbed into Icelandic.

## Get in

### Visas and immigration
Iceland is a member of the Schengen Agreement. See Travelling around the Schengen Area for more information on how the scheme works, what countries are members and what the requirements are for your nationality. In summary:

There are normally no immigration controls between countries that have signed and implemented the treaty; there may be such controls temporarily, such as in connection with important events and various crises.
The operators may carry out identity checks before passengers board international flights, ferries or trains, even between Schengen countries.
Citizens of the EEA countries and Switzerland do not need visas to travel in the Schengen area, and may stay up to 90 days with no requirements other than having a valid ID card or passport. See European Union#EEA citizens.
Normal visas granted by any Schengen member are valid in all countries that have signed and implemented the treaty (with exceptions for some overseas territories). The granting country may offer additional rights (such as longer stays or right to work) that apply only locally.
However, as Iceland is not part of the European Union, all travellers entering Iceland, including those from EU countries, are required to undergo customs inspections on entry.

### By plane

Iceland is easily reached via air and the main international airport is Keflavík Airport (KEF IATA), in the south-west of the country about 40 km (25 mi) from Reykjavík and serves around 30,000 passengers per day in high season. The airport itself is spartan; if you have a lengthy layover you should bring books or other forms of entertainment. Better yet, make sure you can leave the sterile area and explore the country a bit.
Passengers arriving from outside Iceland (including from EU countries) whose final destination is Iceland or who have to recheck baggage will have to go through customs controls at the port of entry (usually at Keflavík), regardless of place of origin. There is a duty-free store in the arrivals baggage claim area where you can purchase duty-free products when in transit to the European mainland. Those coming from countries in the Schengen agreement don't need a separate visa and there are no immigration checks if arriving from other such countries. Airlines will still ask for some form of ID even on flights to/from other Schengen countries.
Passengers travelling on Icelandair between the Americas and Europe are entitled for a stopover of at least one night in Iceland, without additional airfare charges. Icelandair allows up to 7 nights on each leg of the trip.
An airport transfer bus service (called the FlyBus) runs between the airport and Reykjavík BSÍ Bus terminal (kr 3999 one way, 45 minutes; kr 7299 return, as of September 2025). For kr 5199 one way (kr 9399 return; as of September 2025) you can purchase a Flybus+ trip which includes drop-off (and pick-up, if requested the day before) at a select list of hotels in the Greater Reykjavík Area. Even if you're not staying at one of these hotels they might be within walking distance of where you want to go, so depending on your destination using the Flybus+ option you may avoid a taxi ride.
Another great option is to take the bus which stops at the Blue Lagoon either to or from the airport, then continues every half hour or so to Reykjavík. (Netbus is the cheapest option.)
A private transfer service, similar to a taxi but pre-booked, is also available (called Airport Shuttle Iceland) to get from Keflavik International airport to hotels within the greater Reykjavik area. It is not a budget-friendly option for individual travelers, with one way transfer booking for kr 25,500 (as of September 2025).
A metered taxi from the airport to Reykjavík costs about kr 22,000 (as of May 2025).
The following airlines fly to Keflavík:

Nonstop flights on national carrier Icelandair are available at the best value from the US and Canada, with gateways in Baltimore, New York City (JFK); Seattle, Boston, Halifax, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Toronto, Denver, Nashville, Orlando (MCO); Pittsburgh, Portland, OR (PDX);Washington, DC (IAD), Raleigh-Durham; and Vancouver. European destinations beyond Iceland include Amsterdam, Bergen, Berlin, Copenhagen, Dublin, Frankfurt, Glasgow, Gothenburg, Helsinki, Inssbruck, Istanbul, London, Oslo, Madrid, Manchester, Milan, Munich, Nice, Paris, Prague, Stockholm, Düsseldorf, Tenerife, and Stavanger; with Icelandair's hub-and-spoke network connecting via Keflavík in Iceland. (Some destinations are seasonal.)
Delta Air Lines operates seasonal flights between Detroit, Minneapolis/Saint Paul, New York City (JFK) and Keflavík.
EasyJet, offers low-cost flights from the UK: London, Manchester Airport, Edinburgh and Bristol, and to Switzerland: Geneva.
eurowings, has seasonal flights from Cologne.
WizzAir has cheap flights from the Baltics
SAS offers direct flights from Oslo, with connections to Stockholm and the rest of Scandinavia.
Norwegian offers direct flights from Oslo.
British Airways flies from Heathrow Airport in London.
Play has taken up WOWAir's mantle as the budget Icelandic carrier, connecting to a number of European and American East coast cities.
Scheduled service to Greenland and Faroe Islands is provided by Icelandair and Atlantic Airways.

### By boat
Smyril Line sail once or twice a week from Hirtshals in Denmark, via Torshavn in the Faroe Islands (where a stop-over can be made), to Seyðisfjörður on the east coast of Iceland with their ferry Norröna. This is more expensive than flying, but check the different language versions of the Smyril website (.fo, .dk, .co.uk, .de, and .is) for the best deals. Smyril Line no longer sails to Shetland or the Scottish mainland.
But at Seyðisfjörður the journey is only half-done: there's no car hire there so you have to catch an occasional bus to Egilsstaðir Airport in order to either rent a car or catch a domestic flight. Alternatively, you can travel onward by bus to Akureyri, then another bus to Reykjavík. This takes at least two days, is more expensive than a domestic flight, and isn't compatible with much sight-seeing along the way. However, as Norröna is a car ferry, it's possible to travel from mainland Europe to Iceland with your personal car and use that to travel the country and do some sight seeing on the way. See Seyðisfjörður for more on the practicalities.

## Get around

### By plane
Aircraft in Iceland are like buses or trains elsewhere - they're the main form of internal travel other than the roads. Be warned though, that the ride can be a bit bumpy if you're entering one of the fjords like Akureyri.
Domestic flights from Reykjavik operate from Reykjavik Airport, a different airport located closer to the namesake town. Scheduled service to nearby destinations, including Greenland and Faroe Islands, is provided by Icelandair, Atlantic Airways and Eagle Air.

### By car

See also: Driving in Iceland
A car offers the most flexibility for travel around Iceland. Numerous agencies rent vehicles, and ferries allow individuals to bring their own car with them. Rental prices are high (try to book as far in advance as you can) - expect to pay at least 4000 kr per day for a two wheel drive vehicle, and upwards of 12,000 kr per day for a four-wheel-drive vehicle; these prices include basic car insurance, but additional insurance may be purchased to protect against damage from gravel or other common mishaps.
A four-wheel-drive car is needed only in the interior, which is open only in the summer. Renting cars in advance is often cheaper than doing so on-location. Off-road driving is strictly forbidden in Iceland and punishable with fines in the range of 300,000–500,000 kr. Icelandic nature is sensitive and does not recover easily from tire tracks.
Driving in Iceland is on the right side of the road. Headlights and seat belts for all passengers must be on at all times, even on buses. If you are in an accident and not wearing a seat belt, you are considered to be uninsured. There is a single main highway, Route 1-Ring Road, which encircles the country. Because of Iceland's ever-changing weather, one should keep extra food and know where guesthouses and hotels are located in case of a road closure.
Most mountain roads are closed until the end of June, or even longer because of wet and muddy conditions which make them totally impassable. When these roads are opened for traffic, many of them can be passed only by four-wheel-drive vehicles. The roads requiring four-wheel-drive (and possibly snow tires) are route numbers with an "F" prefix, e.g. F128. Some roads that were previously signed with an F have since been upgraded and assigned a number without an F. In general you can trust those designations in both cases.
The general speed limit on Icelandic rural roads is 90 km/h (56 mph) on paved surface and 70 km/h (43 mph) on gravel, in urban areas the general speed limit is 50 km/h (31 mph). Driving on gravel can be a challenge, and loss of control on cliff-side roads can easily be fatal. Speed cameras are posted around the country, and fines are 5,000–70,000 kr. The blood alcohol limit is 0.05%, with a minimum fine of 100,000 kr – don't drink and drive.
Drivers in Iceland should familiarise themselves with road signs and be prepared for Iceland's unique driving conditions. The roads in Iceland are of a medium to low quality, typically made from slightly rough black basalt. There are two signs in particular that foreigners should pay attention to. First, "malbik endar" means that the road changes from a paved road to a gravel road. Slow down before these changes, for one can lose control easily. Also "einbreið brú" means that a one-lane bridge is approaching. Arrive at the bridge slowly and assess the situation. If another car has arrived at the bridge first allow them the right of way.
If you are travelling by road a great site to check is the Iceland Meteorological Office who have an excellent set of pages including the Icelandic Road Administration on all of the main roads.
The Route 1 road that encircles the island nation is a staple for tourists who wishes to see the diverse geological features of Iceland, from waterfalls, icebergs, fjords, to volcanoes.

### By bus

Scheduled trips between Icelandic towns are operated by Strætó bs. Tours to attractions are provided by scheduled buses from various companies, including Reykjavík Excursions (who also operate the FlyBus), Trex, Sterna Travel, NetBus and SBA-NORÐURLEIÐ. Long distance bus travel can cost several thousand kronur and is sometimes more expensive than flying. For example, a one way trip from Reykjavík to Akureyri costs 10,340 kr, while flying costs 8,925 kr (as of May 2019). It is possible to go from the eastern part of the country to the western one by bus in one day, but there are only a few services per day. All public transport services are listed on PublicTransport.is.
Some tours to the interior, in special 4x4 buses, can be a cheaper and more relaxing alternative to driving and serve most major locations (e.g. Landmannalaugar, Thorsmork, Askja). Tours to the interior are scheduled only for the summer months.
Golden Circle day tours are available from Reykjavík from many tour operators which will take you round the Gulfoss waterfall, geysers, the crater and the Mid-Atlantic rift/place of Iceland's first Parliament. Although you don't get much time at each stop, the guide will tell you about Iceland's history and some general information. Cheaper tours (~€55) will be a full-coach whereas more expensive tours (~€80) will be small minibuses or vans. The currency for booking tours can vary from euros, to dollar to krona, so double-check before booking.
The capital area bus system, run by Strætó bs., is an inefficient and expensive mess that can not be relied on. A single fare costs 490 kr (as of March 2022). Bus drivers do not give back change, so if all you have on you is a 500-kr bill, do not expect to get the difference back. The bus system takes either payments through the phone, using their own app or by paying in cash. Sets of tickets are only available through the app. (as of March 2022) If you pay with cash, you will only get a ticket if you ask for one. Tickets from the bus driver and tickets in the app are both valid for 75 minutes.
Buses to the countryside stop running at midnight, but in the capital they run for longer, see Southwest-Iceland for info on that. Some buses even stop earlier, some as early as 18:00. Buses start running at 09:30 to 10:00 on Sundays. Fares to zones 2 and upwards (extending all the way to Höfn and Egilsstaðir) are higher, although all of Reykjavík, Garðabær, Hafnarfjörður, Mosfellsbær, Álftanes and Seltjarnarnes fall within zone one, where the regular fare of 490 kr applies.

### By bicycle
Cycling is a good way to experience Iceland, and provides a very different experience to other means of transport. You should bring your own touring bike, as buying a bike locally can be expensive. Traffic in and out of Reykjavík is heavy, otherwise, it's OK. You can cycle safely on the Ring Road, or take the bike on the buses serving the Ring Road (they are equipped with bicycle racks) and do side trips. However, if going self-supported, considering the weather and conditions, it is strongly advisable to have a previous touring experience.
When cycling in the winter, use studded tyres and dress yourself up in lightweight but warm layers. Bicycle maintenance is typically not a concern, brake pads for example tend to last for 12 months or more, depending on the quality of the brakes.
For trips outside of a town or a city, bring food with you. Icelandic towns can be 100–200 km apart. Food that cooks within 10–15 minutes is preferred. Foraging blueberries and herbs is possible, but do not rely solely on that as a food source.
More information and routes can be found on Cycling Iceland.

### By thumb
Hitchhiking is a cheap way of getting around in Iceland. The country is among the safest in the world, people are quite friendly and the percentage of drivers who do give rides is high, especially in the off-season. Nearly everybody speaks English and most drivers are interested in conversations. However, low traffic in areas outside Reykjavík makes hitchhiking in Iceland an endurance challenge. Even on the main ring-road the frequency of cars is often less than one car per hour in the east.
Avoid hitching after nightfall, especially on Friday and Saturday night. Alcohol consumption is high and alcohol-related accidents are not uncommon.
Hitchhiking into the interior is tough, but everything works if you have enough time – calculating in days, not in hours. For longer distances or less tourist areas be prepared with some food, water and a tent or similar. The weather can be awful and sometimes spoils the fun of this way of travelling.
The HitchWiki website has some advice for hitchhikers.

Vatnajökull glacier is in Southeast Iceland and is Europe's largest glacier.
Jökulsárlón, the largest glacier lake in Iceland, is located off Route 1 and part of Vatnajökull glacier.
In the darker months (September to April), there are frequently stunning views of the Aurora Borealis, a.k.a. Northern Lights anywhere away from city lights. Three conditions need to be true for viewing the northern lights from any given spot: (1) It needs to be dark. The extremely short nights in summers greatly reduce the chance to view the northern lights. Similar impacts come from light pollution from city / street lights (2) The skies need to be free of cloud cover and (3) There needs to be solar activity that sends the charged particles barrelling towards the earth. The magnitude of the visible displays is dependent on chance and can vary over the viewing period as the solar activity and cloud cover changes. There are weather sites that track the chances of seeing the aurora on a given night for a given location, and you can use those ratings to guide you in how late you plan to stay up to see the lights.

## Do

The geothermal spa Blue Lagoon, although being an artificial hot spring, is a very popular sight and activity located between the capital and the main airport. Mývatn Nature Baths is another choice, but it is smaller and in the Eastern part of the country. There also are a lot of local hotpots around the country, but not all of them are safe.
Iceland offers many hiking opportunities. Should you choose to walk outside of walking paths, strong walking boots which support your ankles are recommended as the terrain is usually craggy lava rock or springy moss with hidden holes!
Iceland is not well known for skiing or big ski areas but the town of Akureyri in the north has a great little ski area and the mountains of the Troll Peninsula offer world class terrain for ski touring, ski mountaineering and heli-skiing.
Ice climbing is great with world class frozen waterfalls and plenty of glaciers.
Glacier hiking is one of Iceland´s most popular tourist things to do, with the area of Skaftafell in the south-east being the centre of the activity. There are also other ways to explore the glaciers.
Whale watching is available all year from Reykjavík and during the summer from Husavik.

## Buy

### Money

The local currency is the Icelandic króna, denoted by the abbreviation "kr" (ISO code: ISK).
Coins of Iceland are issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 krónur. Banknotes of Iceland are issued in denominations of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 and 10,000 kr.

#### Exchange
You will get a better rate of exchange if you buy and sell your króna in Iceland. The best exchange rates can usually be found at banks in Reykjavik. Just about every establishment in Iceland will accept a credit card, including taxis, gas stations, souvenir stands, and even the most remote guest house, so it is not necessary to carry large amounts of Icelandic currency.

### Costs
Getting to Iceland can be done fairly cheaply: Icelandair has excellent offers, and Keflavík International Airport is served also by some low-cost airlines.
However, as soon as you step off the plane the situation changes quite drastically – Iceland is generally a very expensive place to visit, due in part to the high import duties and the 25.5% VAT rate. Retail goods can be 3–4 times more expensive than in North America, while grocery prices are at least on par with the most expensive cities. You should budget at least as much money as you would for a trip to Norway or Switzerland.
Useful discount card schemes exist for tourists, the most significant being Reykjavík City Card, operated by the City of Reykjavík.
When shopping for food or other basic necessities, look for the Bónus, Netto or Krónan shops, as they offer considerably lower prices than the others. The centre of Reykjavík is also home to several second-hand stores like those of the Red Cross and the Salvation Army, which can come in handy for buying cheap warm layers.
Expect to spend 700–1200 kr on a pint of beer or glass of wine, 1900–2400 kr on a pizza for one person, 350–900 kr on a coffee or espresso drink and 550 kr on a city bus ride.
Cigarettes cost around 2000 kr for a packet of 30. By law, they must not be visible in shops; however, most gas stations, supermarkets and newsagents sell them.

### Tipping
In Iceland tipping is not practised. In rare cases an attempt to leave a tip may be seen as insulting, so instead consider offering verbal praise for a job well done. Some Icelandic companies have started having a tipping jar next to the cash register but these are generally ignored.

### Shopping
Typical Icelandic products that make good souvenirs include:

Icelandic wool products. Icelandic sheep are a unique breed that produce a soft and durable wool, and Icelandic woollen goods (hats, gloves, etc.) are soft and warm; don't just buy them for other people if you plan to visit the interior.
Arts and crafts. Iceland has a huge number of great little craft shops that sell everything from musical baskets and wonderful weird porcelain sculptures to paintings, glasswork and jewellery. The National Galleries tend to carry the same artist's work in the gift shops rather than the usual mass-marketed products found in so many other museums.
Local music. There is a plethora of interesting local music CDs (beyond just Björk and Sigur Rós) worth hunting for. Obscurities worth picking up include Eberg, Hera, Retro Stefson, FM Belfast, Worm is Green, Múm, Singapore Sling, and Bellatrix. Note that many of these CDs may be available back home as imports for much lower prices. CDs tend to cost 1500–2000 kr.
With the exception of alcohol, accommodations and consumables, you can claim your tax refund at the Arion Bank in the arrivals hall opposite to the car rentals at Keflavik Airport. Only purchases with at least 6000 kr on a single receipt will be eligible for tax refund. Be sure to have your original receipts and the tax free form filled out by the store with you.

## Eat

Traditional Icelandic cuisine tends to be bland and simple due to the limited range of available ingredients as a result of the harsh climate. It is based on staples that use lamb or fish in some form or other. However, technological advances and imports have led to a rather cosmopolitan modern Icelandic cuisine. Modern Scandinavian or New Nordic cuisine has found its way to Iceland, and Reykjavík is home to a number of well-regarded fine dining restaurants. A vegetarian diet is tricky to maintain in Iceland, but there are several vegetarian restaurants in Reykjavík, and vegetarian dishes are widely available at other restaurants.
Distinctively Icelandic foods include:

harðfiskur, dried fish pieces eaten as a snack with butter (also good with coleslaw)
skyr, a yoghurt-like cheese available in flavoured and unflavoured varieties all over the country. Low in fat and high in protein.
hangikjöt, smoked lamb
smoked lamb sausage
svið, singed sheep's head
Slátur, consists of lifrarpylsa, a sausage made from the offal of sheep, and blóðmör which is similar to lifrapylsa but also has sheep's blood mixed into it.
Rúgbrauð, translated into English as "thunder bread", this is a type of rye bread that is baked underground making use of geothermal heat. Sweeter than regular rye breads.
Iceland is famous for its whale meat, and is one of the few places in the world where it is possible to eat minke whale. Whaling has long been a tradition in Iceland, though it has become a controversial issue. However, most restaurants that cater to tourists sell whale meat, and if you are feeling a little more adventurous some places will serve grated puffin with it if you ask.
During the Þorri season (late January-Early February), many Icelanders enjoy Þorramatur, a selection of traditional Icelandic cuisine which usually contains the following: hákarl (putrefied shark cubes), Sviðasulta (brawn [head cheese] made from svið), lundabaggi (sheep's fat) and hrútspungar (pickled ram's testicles). Þorramatur is usually served at gatherings known as Þorrablót. If you are invited to a Þorrablót, do not be afraid to (politely) refuse some of the more unpalatable delicacies, as many Icelanders choose to do so as well. Don't worry about going hungry, though, as many of the more "normal" foods mentioned above are almost always available too. If you're uncertain which is which, do not be afraid to ask the caterers for assistance.
A similar event to Þorrablót is Þorláksmessa, celebrated on 23 December each year. During this day you might find yourself invited to skötuveislur, where cured skate is served. As with Þorrablót, you can politely refuse to partake in the skate (another type of fish is usually served alongside it for the less adventurous). A word of warning, though: the pungent smell that accompanies the cooking of cured skate is very strong and sticks to hair and clothing very easily. Do not wear formal (expensive) clothing at these gatherings, especially not clothing you intend to wear during Christmas.

Any Icelander's first choice of fast food is usually the pylsa or hot dog. It uses a lamb sausage and is usually served with a choice of fried onions, fresh onions, ketchup, mustard and remoulade. It is cheap compared with other fast food staples at around 350 kr, and is sold in every one of the small convenience stores/eateries/video rentals/sweet shops that litter Icelandic towns. At least in Reykjavik, you can also encounter food trucks and carts selling piping hot lamb meat soup (kjötsúpa). They also have a vegetarian alternative – the same soup minus the meat.
Food prices are particularly high in Iceland – the following sample prices were accurate as of summer 2016:

350–500 kr for a hotdog
1000–2000 kr for a hamburger.
3000–6000 kr for a three-course meal in a restaurant.

## Drink

Tap water is safe to drink in Iceland and it is one of the countries with the cleanest water in the world. Coffee is easy to find and is comparable to what is found throughout Europe. Juices are generally imported and made from concentrate.
Alcoholic drinks are very expensive compared to the UK and US; an example, half a litre of Viking beer in a bar will cost approximately kr 900. Liquor can be purchased at licensed bars, restaurants, or Vínbúðin, the state monopoly (locally known as Ríkið: "the state") liquor bought there is much cheaper than at bars, there you pay 350 kr for the same beer you paid 900 kr for at the bar. The local Icelandic drinks such as Brennivín ("burning wine") contain a fairly high alcohol content, so pace yourself while at the bars.
The local beer brands are:

Egils: Lite, Gull, Pilsner, Premium, El Grillo
Vífillfell: Thule, Gull, Lite, Víking
Bruggsmiðjan: Kaldi
Ölvisholt Brewery: Skjálfti
Ölgerð Reykjavíkur: Gullfoss
For visitors arriving by air, there is a duty free store for arriving passengers where they can buy cheap alcohol (at least cheap compared to Iceland). To find the duty free store just follow the Icelanders. No Icelander in their right mind will pass the duty free store upon arrival!
Be sure to not exceed the allowance which is 1 litre strong alcohol and 1 litre light wine (less than 22%) or 1 litre strong and 6 litres of beer. The strong alcohol can be exchanged for either 1 litre light wine or 6 litre beer.
The drinking age in Iceland is 18 for all alcoholic beverages, but the buying age is 20.

## Sleep

If you're visiting in summertime you won't regret bringing an eye mask with you. During the height of summer there is no actual darkness and in the north, the sun might just dip for a few minutes below the horizon.
For travel during the high season (July and August), and even in September, reserving a month or more in advance can help ensure that you find suitable and affordable accommodation. Reserving later can put you at risk of having to take more costly accommodation.
The hotels are usually fairly basic around the island but you can usually get a room even in August just by phoning them up and reserving it before you get there. They are clean and well maintained, light and airy with nothing at all that could even remotely be considered 'dingy'. They are expensive though.
Fosshotels is a chain of 12 hotels located throughout Iceland, close to the island's most treasured nature spots and major cities of Iceland. The most popular hotel is Fosshotel Nupar, located in by the National Park Skaftafell. The accommodation in Fosshotel hotels is diverse and Scandinavian breakfast buffet is always included. Fosshotels are part of Hotels of Iceland.
Berjaya Iceland Hotels include the Edda summer hotels and the Berjaya Iceland hotels. Berjaya Iceland Hotels are upscale, Scandinavian-style hotels located in most major cities of Iceland. Most notable is the Nordica on the outskirts of central Reykjavík.
Guesthouses are between hotels and hostels in prices and services. At some times if travelling in groups the guesthouses can be cheaper than the hostels. Guesthouses will usually have more space than a hostel with a shared bathroom that is cleaner and less crowded. Icelandic Farm Holidays: the members are farmers who offer accommodation to travellers in their homes, guesthouses, country-hotels and cottages. The association was founded in 1980 and from 1990 Icelandic Farm Holidays has been a fully licensed tour operator and a travel agent. The accommodation is diverse; made up beds in four different categories, with or without private bathroom, sleeping bag accommodation, cottages and camping. Some of the farms offer also various recreation; horse riding, fishing, hunting, sailing, swimming, glacier tours, golf, etc. You can get their brochure from tourist information centres or find it on their website. It is very informative and lists all farms, the services they provide, at what time of the year and contact information. It is best to call in advance to book, especially in the summer.
Iceland has many hostels throughout the entire country. Thirty-seven of them belong to Hostelling International Iceland and it is best it to buy the international membership card (if you do not have it already), if you are staying for four or more nights at HI hostels in Iceland or abroad within the next 12 months. Bring your bedlinen or sleeping bag to avoid extra costs.
If you're travelling on a budget, camping is your best bet. There are sites located throughout the country, especially at places you'd want to visit. They range from fully-equipped (hot showers, washing machines, cooking facilities) to farmers' fields with a cold-water tap. Expect to pay kr 1200-2000 per person per night. If you intend to camp in Iceland you must be prepared for the cold, 3-season sleeping bags are essential and an inner. Thick pyjamas and a warm hat are also recommended! A bedding roll is also useful as you may end up sleeping on very rough ground. Don't wait until last minute to find a place to camp. Campers and mobile homes have become immensely popular among Icelanders and they take up a lot of space. You could arrive at a large camping ground that's so filled up with campers and mobile homes that you'll have no place to pitch your tent. It is however, not allowed to camp or park a mobile home anywhere other than these campsites!
Trekkers will need to use some of the mountain huts, either government or privately-run. These range from dormitory accommodation to fully-staffed facilities. Booking ahead is likely to be necessary at popular times of year (and they may be accessible only in summertime).
Don't bother attempting to sleep in Keflavík Airport overnight. It's far better to find a hotel in Keflavík or Reykjavík before arrival. If there are no flights to be serviced in the middle of the night (which is most often the case) the airport is closed for a few hours at night and you might have to stand outside in the rain and wind.

## Learn
Iceland has eight universities, the oldest and most important of which is the University of Iceland. Public universities in Iceland are heavily subsidised by the government, and hence charge very little in tuition fees. The University of Iceland, for instance, charges only kr 75,000 annually in tuition fees for international students. However, be sure to factor in Iceland's high cost of living when planning your finances. Courses are generally taught in Icelandic, though some courses for exchange students are taught in English. The universities also conduct classes for foreigners to learn Icelandic.

## Work
Citizens of the Nordic Countries (including Greenland), the EU/EEA countries and Switzerland have an unrestricted right to work in Iceland.
If you're not from these countries, getting a work permit can be difficult. Iceland has a relatively strict immigration policy and the government isn't too keen on letting foreigners take away jobs from Icelandic citizens. However, with a booming tourist industry since the 2010s, there are quite some immigrants in the workforce.
Citizens of other countries who do not need a visa to visit Iceland can apply for a long-term visa for remote workers (digital nomads) and live in the country for a limited time (90–180 days) with spouse and under-age children, provided also these fulfil the visa-free condition. They must, however, prove that they make 1,000,000 kr monthly (1.3 million if including a cohabiting partner). Holders of a digital nomad visa will not be issued a national ID number. The visa does not allow you to get locally employed.
To get a work, a great deal of emphasis is placed on family ties, personal relationships, and connections. Try to find and use such connections.
Beware of offers for contracted work in Iceland. Your wage levels may be lower than average and your rights may be affected. Iceland is a highly unionised society with over 90% of the workforce in labour unions.
A great resource is the Directorate of Labour website.

## Stay safe
Iceland is one of the safest countries in the world with regard to crime, so there is almost no chance of getting robbed or harassed. Isolated incidents have, however, been reported, especially in Reykjavík, so it pays to take the usual precautions. Use common sense when sampling the night life.
For severe weather, volcanic eruptions, etc., check alerts from Icelandic weather institution. Keep your phone on, as some alerts are sent as SMS to all mobile phones in the affected area.

### Authorities
The emergency phone number is 112, as in most of Europe. The police are generally polite, professional and honest, and people often comment that they are very helpful and courteous. Icelandic police officers do not carry firearms on standard patrol; incidents requiring firearms are typically left to the Viking Squad, Iceland's police tactical unit.

### Nature

Sure, Iceland's beauty may lie in its scenery and weather, but don't let that tempt you too much. Do not walk on glaciers without proper training and equipment, do not approach a glacier front, do not approach waves on the coast, and do not approach a large waterfall. Every year, many tourists get injured and killed by doing all of this. By being more aware of your location, your surroundings, and the dangers of Iceland's harsh nature, you can prevent a fatal incident. Glaciers and waterfalls can be enjoyed with appropriate skills, on a guided tour, or where safe areas are signposted.
Be prepared for sudden shifts in the weather. Weather in Iceland is unpredictable and its winters can be frigid. Do not walk out in the open in windy weather in the winter: you will become exhausted very quickly. You should make it a point to keep up to date with the country's weather and road conditions daily.
Don't go on long hikes even in summer without somebody who knows how to cope with the dangers.

### Natural disasters
Iceland is a volcanically active country. On average, the country experiences a volcanic eruption every four years. If there is one during your stay, pay attention to local news and government warnings. Sure, it may be tempting to look at a volcanic eruption from a distance, but the eruptions can be explosive and violent. Furthermore, volcanic gas can be toxic and even lethal.
Since Iceland is situated on two shifting tectonic plates, earthquakes are quite common in Iceland. On average, the country experiences 500 earthquakes per year. Many earthquakes are small and are not that noticeable. Know this one thing: whenever there's a big earthquake, a volcanic eruption will follow.

### Driving

Driving in Iceland can be a dangerous experience. Wandering livestock, harsh weather conditions, foggy conditions, and a largely unpaved road network can make things challenging.
About a third of the country's road network is paved and many roads outside the capital are impassible during the winters (October to April). During the summers, roads can become muddy.
If you have no experience with driving in isolated areas with harsh weather conditions or knowledge of Icelandic roads, it is strongly recommended that you do not drive outside of Reykjavik. Outside the capital, help is limited, and if you do not know what you're doing, you can easily get lost or stranded.
If you absolutely must drive outside the capital, a useful resource to check out is Vegagerdin. Also, consider informing a trusted local about your plans.

### Drugs
The Icelandic Narcotics Police has a very strict policy on drugs; minimum fine for possession of under 1 gram (3/100 of an ounce) of any illegal substance can result in a fine of over 70,000 kr.

## Stay healthy
The medical facilities in Iceland are good and subsidised for those with a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and passport. Scandinavian citizens must show a valid passport to get subsidised medical costs.
Should EU citizens not have the necessary documents then they will be charged for the full cost of the medical treatment. Citizens outside of EU should check if their travel insurance covers medical treatment.
Infectious diseases aren't a problem in Iceland. Inoculations aren't required except if you are arriving from countries that suffer from infectious diseases like cholera.
The biggest threat to your health is likely to be accidental injury or bad weather. Always make sure you have more than adequately warm and waterproof clothing. Selection of appropriate clothing is especially important in Iceland and can even be a matter of life and death. Exercise extra caution in geothermal areas: What may appear to be solid ground can sometimes be not so solid, breaking from underneath your feet with you falling into potentially deadly boiling water.
The water quality in Iceland is excellent and tap water is always drinkable. The hot water coming from the tap smells a bit like sulphur, because it is heated by geothermal energy, but it is also safe to drink.
The hygiene in public kitchens is very good, and food poisoning rarely happens to tourists.

## Respect

It is not uncommon for an Icelander to ask a foreigner about their opinion of Iceland. The standard question is: "How do you like Iceland?" You don't have to excessively praise the country to be on an Icelander's good side; just be polite. Do not refer to the Icelandic horse as a pony.
As this is one of the least populated countries in the world, don't be surprised if people in town have heard about your stay.
There is a sense of community and belonging in Iceland. It's not uncommon for people in small towns and villages to know each other on a personal level, and Icelandic parents are intimately involved in the life choices of their children.
Icelanders have a near-obsessive fascination with genealogy and charting family history is a popular pastime activity. The Icelanders even have an online database called Íslendingabók, which contains genealogical information about all Icelanders.
As is the case in all of the Nordic countries, Iceland is an egalitarian country. Everyone, regardless of their vocation, is treated equally. Acting like you're a VIP will be frowned upon and will get you nowhere.
As is the case in all of the Nordic countries, modesty is a virtue. Bragging and showing off are frowned upon and are widely associated with uncouth behaviour.
Some Icelanders claim to believe in the hidden people — called huldufólk — and a few even claim to have seen them. They are analogous to elves but are often considered separate. There is even a museum in Reykjavík devoted to the hidden people. This is an ancient Icelandic belief and most Icelanders respect the tradition. Skepticism thus can appear rude.
It is customary for one to take one's shoes off after entering private homes. In case your hosts do not mind, they will say so.
Punctuality is not as important in Iceland as it is in many other northern European countries. People may often not appear until 15 minutes later than the stated time, and even much later than that for parties or other social gatherings.
When speaking English, Icelanders may use the word fuck more often than expected by Anglophones. This is because brusque opinions are commonly expressed and should not be taken badly and also, the Icelandic equivalent of this word is not as strong a swear word as in English.

### Sensitive issues
The Great Recession is a highly emotive, polarising issue. During the Great Recession, the country's banking system collapsed, the country's stock market crashed, and ordinary people lost a great deal of purchasing power.
Iceland is one of only a few countries with an active whaling industry, and if you choose to assert an anti-whaling position expect some Icelanders to have strong pro-whaling opinions, be well prepared to argue the issue and do not expect to win the argument. Icelandic opposition to the practice of whaling comes from the inhumane way the animals are killed. It takes two to three harpoons to kill the whale, and it takes about 15 mins to die. But Icelanders will not be willing to listen to foreigners tell them what to do. Most whale meat is exported from Iceland and is in general not available for purchase locally.
Although Lutheranism is the state religion and nominally adhered to by the majority of Icelanders, contemporary Iceland is for the most part rather secular, and only a minority of Icelanders go to church regularly. Nevertheless, even non-religious Icelanders tend to be proud of their churches. Freedom of religion is generally respected so long as you do not proselytise or inconvenience others with your religious beliefs.

## Connect

### Telephone
In case of emergency call 112 from any phone.
Such calls are free and will be answered by an emergency services operator who will ask you which services you need (police, fire, ambulance, coastguard, rescue teams, civil protection and protection against child abuse) and for your location.
Phone numbers for non-urgent calls to these services differ to where you are situated in the country. Calls for non-urgent medical services in the capital region should be made on 1770.
Directory enquiries (number lookup) of Icelandic phone numbers are provided by the Icelandic telecom, in the telephone number 1818.
The Icelandic country code is 354. When calling Iceland from overseas, dial your international access code (with mobile phones, you can use "+" instead) followed by subscriber number; Iceland does not use area codes. Calling from Iceland, the international access code is 00, as in most of Europe. 
Payphones are not common, due to widespread use of mobile phones.
Costs for calls from a landline phone are based on a dial-up fee along with a fee for each minute. The dial up fee for all domestic phones is typically 3 kr, each minute to landlines costs 10 kr and each minute to GSM costs around 21 kr (as of December 2014).

### Mobile
Mobile phones are heavily used. The main networks are Icelandic Telecom, Sýn and Nova. All of them have 4G services, which have equal coverage, covering most of the country. 2G will shut down in 2024 and 3G in 2025. 5G includes the same frequencies as in mainland Europe, the 3.6GHz band started being populated in 2020.
Given that the call is from domestic numbers, there is no charge for calls that you receive on your handset.
Pay as you go (prepaid) plans are available from all three networks. Credit the phone up with a top-up card, at an ATM or at the website of your telecommunications company; there is no contract and no bills. Some operators also offer packages which mix texts, phone calls and data at affordable rates. These packages can come with your initial top-up or deducted from your balance. Additionally, if you have a SIM from another EU/EEA country, you can use your SIM in Iceland under "roam like home" terms subject to your home provider's EU roaming policy. 
If you have an unlocked GSM-compatible handset (check band compatibility), you can purchase a SIM card from phone outlets.
Costs for calls from a mobile are based on a dial-up fee along with a fee for each minute. The dial-up fee for all domestic numbers is typically 15 kr, each minute to all domestic phones costs 25 kr and each text message 15 kr, although Vodafone and Nova also sell prepaid plans with unlimited voice included. The cost for Internet access is 12 kr per megabyte (as of May 2019).

### Internet
Internet hot spots can be found at restaurants, cafés and airports. For the customers of those places, the Internet is free of charge.
A large portion of Iceland has 3G coverage. 3G and 4G data services should roam seamlessly onto Icelandic networks. USB data cards that offer connectivity to 3G or 4G are available from the Icelandic telecommunications companies.
