# Egypt

Egypt (Arabic: مصر, Miṣr or Maṣr) is known for its world-famous pyramids, mummies, temples, art, churches, mosques, bustling cities, friendly people, and hieroglyphics, Egypt is considered a cradle of civilisation and has one of the longest histories of any country in the world. Egypt may perhaps have the oldest tourist industry in the world; Egypt has been visited by millions of people since ancient times.
There is a lot to do for the foreign traveller in Egypt. Apart from visiting and seeing the temples and artefacts of ancient Egypt, there is also much to see within each city. In fact, each city in Egypt has its own charm of things to see with its own history, culture, activities, and people who often differ in nature from people of other parts of Egypt.

## Understand

Egypt is a large, transcontinental country spanning North Africa and the Middle East. It is the world's 29th largest country, with a land area of 1,010,408 square kilometres (390,121 sq mi). It is one of Africa's largest countries, one of the most populated countries in the Arab world. 
The country is bounded by the Mediterranean and Red Seas (to the north and east respectively) and geographically dominated both by the Nile River and its fertile well-watered valley, and by the Eastern and Western deserts.

### History

The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom arose around 3200 BC and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 BC, who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. 
The Arabs introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the Mamluks, took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. 
Following the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub, but also fell heavily into debt. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Egypt gained partial independence from the UK in 1922, but the British continued to use Egypt as a base for influence in the region. Egypt saw fighting during World War II, such as the famous battle at El Alamein. In the constitution of 1923, Egypt was a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system. 
In 1952, riots protesting against the British led to a coup d'état by the military. Egypt was declared a republic, but soon with all civilian parties banned. The Egyptian leaders Nasser, Sadat and Mubarak played important roles in the politics of the Middle East. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honoured place of the Nile River in agriculture and the ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society.
The Arab Spring of 2011 led to the resignment of President Mubarak, a new provisional constitution and the Muslim Brotherhood winning the parliamentary election, largely seen as the first free elections ever in Egypt, as well as the presidency – the Brotherhood had been considered illegal most of the time since its foundation in 1928. However, the Supreme Constitutional Court declared the parliamentary elections unconstitutional. The legal disputes were accompanied by protests and clashes between supporters and people who feared an Islamistic takeover.
In 2013, general Abdel Fattah el-Sisi led a coup d'état, and won the presidency with 97% of the votes the following year, in an election marred with irregularities, repression of political opponents, and suppression of free speech. The country returned to authoritarianism. Presidential terms were lengthened from four to six years, and el-Sisi was allowed to be re-elected for a third term in 2023. 
The government has struggled to prepare the economy for the 21st century through economic reform and massive investment in communications and physical infrastructure.

### Climate
Egypt's climate is generally classified as desert. It is an extension of the great Sahara that bands North Africa, and except for the thin strip of watered land along the Nile River, very little could survive there. As the ancient Greek historian Herodotus stated: "Egypt is the gift of the Nile".
Beware that from March till May, sand storms may occur, particularly during daytime. These storms not only make the air sandy and very dry, but also temporarily raise the temperature. Sand storms at other times of the year can still erupt but rarely and in winter, usually they won't raise the temperature.

Generally, the summers are hot, rainless and extremely sunny, but the air can be humid at the coasts and very dry at the south, away of the coasts and away of the Nile Delta. The winters are moderate. November through March are definitely the most comfortable months for travel in Egypt. Only the north coast (stretching from the sea to 50 km southwards) receives a little rain in winter; the rest of Egypt receives negligible or no rain.
Thunderstorms along with heavy rain showers that often last several hours are not uncommon in Alexandria, Marsa Matruh and all other northern coastal areas, and even the Delta. In some years the rainstorms can last for a whole day or so, though the rain tends to be lighter. Hail is also not uncommon, especially out in the desert where the weather is usually colder and allows for soft hail to fall and even frost to form on non-rainy days.
In the Sinai Mountains and also the Red Sea mountains, which stretch along the east side of the country along the shore of the Red Sea, there is generally more rain than the surrounding desert, as rain clouds tend to develop when warm air evaporates and rises as it moves across higher terrain. Floods in these areas are a common weather phenomenon as so much rain can fall in a very short amount of time (often a day or two), with thunder and lightning as well. Because of the desert and lack of abundant vegetation, the water from the rain quickly falls down across the hills and mountains and floods local areas. Every year there are stories in the local newspapers about flash floods in areas of the Sinai and also in Upper Egypt (southern Egypt) such as in Assiut, Luxor, Aswan, and Sohag. These floods, however, only generally happen two or three times a year, and do not happen at all in some years. When they happen, though, it is often in early times of the season such as in September or October, or in late winter such as February. Because of this risk, one should be careful when venturing out into the desert or camping in certain areas, as water can suddenly rush down from the nearby mountains and hills. It can sometimes carry a quite strong current that has been known to break down homes of rural people who build their homes from mud, bricks, and other weak materials. Poor people might drown in the floods, which is strange for a desert country that doesn't receive much precipitation.
Also, in higher elevations such as on top of the Sinai mountains, temperatures can drop much more than the surrounding areas, allowing for snowfall in winter months, since temperatures can drop down to below freezing, as well as formation of frost even in the low lying desert areas where the temperatures are generally several degrees colder than in the cities.
December, January and February are the coldest months of the year. However, winter days of southern places at the Nile Valley are warmer, but their nights are as cool as northern places.
Visitors should be aware that most houses and apartments in Egypt do not have central heating like countries with colder climates, because the main weather concern in Egypt is the heat. Therefore, even though the weather might not be so cold for a westerner, inside the apartment it might be colder at day but the temperature indoors is more stable than outdoors. In Cairo, in indoor buildings without air-conditioning, temperatures are about 15°C (59°F) in the coldest winter days and about 34°C (93°F) in the hottest summer days.

### Holidays
Banks, shops and businesses close for the following Egyptian national holidays (civil and religious), and public transport may run only limited services:

7 January (Eastern Orthodox Christmas)
25 January (Egyptian Revolution Day)
25 April (Sinai Liberation Day)
1 May (Labour Day)
23 July (July Revolution Day)
6 October (Armed Forces Day)
1st Shawwal, the 10th Hijri month (Eid al Fitr, "Breakfast Feast")
10th Dhu al Hijjah, the 12th Hijri month (Eid al Adha, "Sacrifice Feast")
Working for shorter day hours for 29 or 30 days of Ramadan
Since Islamic holidays are based on the lunar calendar, their exact dates vary between years

#### Ramadan

Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and the most important month in the Islamic Calendar for Muslims, the majority religion in Egypt. During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from eating, drinking or smoking until after sundown on each day. Although strict adherence to Ramadan is for Muslims only, some Muslims appreciate that non-Muslims do not take meals or smoke in public places. During Ramadan, many restaurants and cafes won't open until after sundown. Public transport is less frequent, shops close earlier before sunset and the pace of life (especially business) is generally slow.
As expected, exactly at sunset minute, the entire country quiets down and busy itself with the main meal of the day (iftar, "breaking-fast") that are almost always done as social events in large groups of friends. Many richer people offer tables (Tables of the Gracious God موائد الرحمن) in Cairo's streets that cater full-meals for free for the passers-by, the poorer ones or workers who couldn't leave their shifts at the time. Prayers become popular 'social' events that some like to enrich with special food treats before and after. An hour or two later, an astonishing springing to life of the cities takes place. Streets sometimes richly decorated for the whole month have continuous rush hours till very early in the morning. Some shops and cafes make the biggest chunk of their annual profit at this time of year. Costs of advertising on television and radio soars for this period and entertainment performances are at their peak.

### Terrain
Egypt consists of vast desert plateau interrupted by the Nile valley and delta, along with the Sinai peninsula. Portions of the Nile River valley are bounded by steep rocky cliffs, while the banks are relatively flat in other areas, allowing for agricultural production.

### Spelling
There is no standard way of transcribing Arabic words into western script. The main effect on these pages is on place names, and that little word el for "the" - a common prefix - is a good example. Arabic doesn't spell out short vowels so el could also be "al" or "il" (sometimes even "ul"). It doesn't distinguish upper and lower case, and words are run together rather than hyphenated, so el could also be "El", "El-" or "el-". Permute the short vowels and you've got twelve ways to spell a place. And then there are the "sun letters" such as "Sh" which assimilate the "el" when spoken, though the Arabic spelling doesn't alter. Thus "Sharm el-Sheikh" is pronounced "Sharm esh-Sheikh"; western script preserves the "el" in that example but for other towns may follow the pronunciation. The Arabic glottal stop may be transcribed as an apostrophe or omitted. "Q" may be transcribed "Qu" or "K" or "Kh" or not at all, since the Egyptian "koph" is often silent. But after that it gets complicated ....
Individual pages here tend to settle on a particular spelling for consistency, but there's inevitable variation on other pages and other sources such as maps.

### Tourist information
Egypt Travel website

## Get in

Egypt's economy depends a great deal on tourism; therefore, most people can enter the country without a visa. Unlike neighbouring Libya and Sudan, Egypt allows Israeli citizens to visit Egypt. 

### Visa

As a major tourist destination whose economy is dependent upon tourist money, Egypt is relatively easy to enter and obtain visas for. There are three types of Egyptian visa:

Tourist Visa — usually valid for 3 months or less and granted on either a single or multiple entry basis
Entry Visa — required for any foreigner arriving in Egypt for purposes other than tourism, e.g. work or study. The possession of a valid Entry Visa is needed to complete the residence procedure in Egypt.
Transit Visa — rarely needed and only for certain nationalities
e-Visa (or online visa) is available for many countries; check with your government website for clarification.
Entry visas may be obtained from Egyptian diplomatic and consular missions abroad or from the Entry Visa Department at the Travel Documents, Immigration and Nationality Administration (TDINA). Non-Egyptians are required to have a valid passport.
Visa on arrival is available for many western countries; see below. However, citizens of the following countries are required to have a visa before arriving, which must be applied for through an Egyptian consulate or embassy outside of Egypt:

Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, China PR, Comoros, R Congo, DR Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kenya, DPR Korea, R Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palestine, Philippines, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey (except those aged below 20 and above 45), Turkmenistan, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

Visitors entering Egypt at the overland border crossing at Taba or at Sharm el Sheikh airport can be exempted from a visa and granted a free fourteen day entry visa to visit the Aqaba coast of the Sinai peninsula, including Sharm el Sheikh, Dahab and St. Catherine's Monastery. Visitors wishing to leave the Sinai peninsula and to visit Cairo and other Egyptian cities are required to hold full Egyptian visas. These are not issued at the Taba border crossing and must be acquired in advance either in the country of residence, at the Egyptian consulate in Eilat or at the airport upon arrival. Visitors on organized tours can often have their visas issued at the border, but should verify in advance with their travel agent or tour operator that this option is available. Those in possession of a residence permit are not required to obtain an entry visa if they leave the country and return to it within the validity of their residence permit or within six months, whichever period is less.
Tourists visiting Sharm el Sheikh who are planning to undertake scuba diving outside local areas (i.e. Ras Mohammed) must obtain the tourist visa in order to leave the Sharm el Sheikh area. Officials on boats may check dive boats whilst on the waters so you are advised to obtain the visa beforehand: there may be fines involved for you and the boat captain if you are caught without the appropriate visa. Most reputable dive centres will ask to see your visa before allowing you on trips.
Egypt has peaceful relations with Israel, but the degree of friendliness varies, and with it, the direct connections between the two countries. A direct air service between Cairo and Tel Aviv is operated by EgyptAir under the guise of "Air Sinai". Bus service seems to continue, as described below. In any case, verify the situation as you plan, and again at the last minute.

#### Visa on arrival
Citizens of Bahrain, Guinea, South Korea, Libya, Oman, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen receive a 3-month visa on arrival. Citizens of Kuwait can obtain 6-month Residence Permit upon arrival. China and Malaysian citizens receive a 15-day visa on arrival. Citizens of China (only Hong Kong and Macau SAR) may have a 30-day visit without visa.
Citizens of UK, EU, Australia, Canada, Croatia, Georgia, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Macedonia, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Serbia, Ukraine and United States may also obtain a visa on arrival at major points of entry.
The visa on arrival is US$25 for everyone. You will not necessarily need US dollars, most major currencies, down to small notes ($1, €5, £5), are accepted and exchanged by the visa fee collecting officer at a more than fair rate. The officer will also put the visa fee sticker into your passport, with which you will have to pass through passport control. The sticker is quite loose: if you feel like it is at the wrong location or taking too much space, you can move it to a more convenient location, or hide a stamp with it that you might want to conceal for certain reasons.

### By plane

Egypt has several international airports:
Cairo International Airport is the primary entry point and the hub of the national carrier,  Egyptair. Sphinx International Airport is Cairo's second airport, 45 km west of the city, and served by a handful of low-cost carriers. Capital International Airport is the newest airport, opened in 2019, to serve the yet-unnamed new capital of Egypt.
Borg el Arab International Airport serves all flights into Alexandria. 
Hurghada International Airport is a major airport for budget tourists coming into Egypt and staying along the Red Sea. Many airlines to Hurghada can be booked without paying for a holiday package. Sharm El Sheikh International Airport is another of the cheapest options to get into Egypt.
Further up the Nile, Luxor International Airport receives international scheduled flights, mostly from Europe, and charter flights.
Egypt's other international airports are in Aswan, Marsa Alam, Assiut, El Alamein, 
Marsa Matruh, Sohag, and Taba.

### By boat

Ferries run regularly from Aqaba across to Nuweiba on the Sinai peninsula, bypassing Israel and the sometimes complicated border arrangements. Generally there is no visa fee for entering Jordan through Aqaba since it is a part of the free trade zone. The line to Nuweiba is operated by AB Maritime. It is also possible to travel from Saudi Arabia to several Red Sea coast ports.
A weekly ferry ran between Wadi Halfa, Sudan and Aswan, connecting with the train from Khartoum, although this route is no longer open due to the civil war in Sudan.
There are no scheduled passenger ferries between Europe and Egypt. For those intent to recreate the classical way of reaching Egypt, freighter travel remains an option.

### By bus

Travelling to Egypt by bus is a cheaper option than short-haul flights from neighbouring countries. A trip between Aqaba in Jordan and Cairo costs as little as US$55 (Dec 2022, including the departure taxes of Jordan and Israel as well as entry tax of Egypt). From Eilat in Israel it's about US$40 (Dec 2022, including the Israel departure tax and Egypt entry tax). Foreigners entering Egypt by bus must pay a LE63 tax. The downside, of course, is that it's time consuming and, even if buses nowadays have plush seats and air conditioning, quite uncomfortable as you're confined to a seat for 7–10 hr from Taba to Cairo. To avoid that you can have a stopover of one or more nights in Sharm el-Sheikh or Dahab.
Israel is the most popular country to travel by bus from and travellers can easily access Egypt by bus from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. However, there are no cross-border services. The most common route is to take a bus to Eilat where you can cross over the border into Taba and take a bus to Cairo or into the Sinai. Generally, only two or three buses leave from Taba to the various destinations each day; one morning and one afternoon service, with an early evening departure from time to time. Plan the arrival in Eilat accordingly, and be prepared to spend the night in either Eilat or Taba if arriving late. As usual, crossing into Israel by bus means getting your passport stamped and many Arab countries denying you entry (see Visa trouble).
Other routes to Cairo include: direct services from Amman twice a week by the Jordanian state bus company, JETT, daily services by SAPTCO from Dammam, Jeddah and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia and buses from Benghazi, although those can be suspended due to the fluid security situation there. Journey times for all these services are between 25 and 40 hours.

## Get around

### By plane
Overland journeys between cities in Egypt are often long, hot, bumpy, dusty, and not altogether safe. There is a good domestic air network, and advance fares are not expensive, so flying internally is often a good option.
Cairo has direct flights to every other major city except Alexandria, including Luxor, Aswan, Abu Simbel, Hurghada, Sharm el-Sheikh, Marsa Matruh, Marsa Alam and Kharga oasis. These run at least daily, and the main cities have several flights a day. There are also daily flights directly between Alexandria, Aswan, Luxor, Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh.
Most flights are operated by the national carrier, EgyptAir. This is the first place to go looking. Some internet booking sites (e.g. Expedia) don't offer their flights – it'll appear as if you need to fly via Istanbul or similar nonsense. Egyptair doesn't do phone sales, but they have lots of booking offices in the centres (your hotel can point these out), which saves you if you don't have internet access.
There are rival airlines such as Nile Air and Al Masria. Nile Air has flights from Cairo and Alexandria. Al Masria flies to Cairo from Hurghada, and Sharm El Sheikh. Foreign package airlines (e.g. TUI) sometimes fly an internal route, but that's to move their clients around on multi-centre holidays, and they're not available to book as point-to-point domestic flights.

### By train

Egypt's mainline railway follows the Nile: from Aswan north through Luxor to Cairo and Alexandria. Branch lines fan out across the Nile delta, as far east as Suez and Port Said, and west along the coast through El Alamein as far as Mersa Matruh. Train is an excellent, although relatively expensive, way to travel between Cairo and Alexandria, and between Luxor and Aswan, with frequent daytime services taking 2–3 hrs. Trains also run between Cairo and Luxor and Aswan, both daytime and overnight. There are no trains to the Red Sea resorts or to Siwa oasis.
Almost all trains are run by the state-owned company Egyptian National Railways (ENR) (the exception is the Cairo-Luxor-Aswan sleeper run by Watania, described below). Express trains have air-conditioned classes called AC1 and AC2 (1st and 2nd class). They are clean and comfortable. For ordinary trains the classes AC1 and AC2 are likewise available, with A/C sometimes in AC1, but never in AC2. Fares were once very cheap by Western standards, but as of 2022, foreigners now must buy foreigner tickets to ride Egyptian trains. Expect to pay around USD $110 between Cairo and Luxor, for example. Punctuality could be described as "not bad for Egypt": trains generally start out from their first station on time but pick up delays along the way. Delays of up to an hour are not uncommon, especially between Cairo and Luxor. So, if your train is coming from somewhere else, do not expect it to be on time.
In addition, local 3rd class trains are a great way to explore attractions in the surrounding area. They can also be used for longer distances if you want to connect with the locals and are on a tight budget. 3rd class sounds worse than it actually is—the chairs are wooden but the interior is sometimes painted well. The local train schedule is not available online, so you need to make enquiries at the station. Be insistent, they might just tell you the regular train schedule that you already know from the ENR website, expecting that you would not want to use anything beyond AC2 or even beyond AC1. Also, information can sometimes be very hard to confirm; which time, which platform, which stops. It is best to ask several people/officers and find out what they say. Or have a look at the station departure board a day or so before your intended travel, chances are trains run same time every day. Some local trains can get quite full, but mostly only the ones that travel far.

Buy tickets in advance, since at peak travel times, trains may be fully booked, especially the inexpensive ones. Except during busy holiday periods, it's not normally difficult to purchase tickets on the day of travel or the day before. To avoid complications, book as far ahead as possible.
The sleeper service Cairo-Luxor-Aswan is run by Abela Trains, a private company. Buy tickets online from them, as ENR do not show those services on their timetable and do not sell tickets.

### By bus
Egypt has an extensive long-distance bus network, operated mostly by government-owned companies. Among the largest companies are Blue Bus Bedouin Bus, Pullman, West Delta, Golden Arrow, Super Jet, East Delta, El Gouna, Go Bus and Upper Egypt Bus Co. Popular routes are operated by more than one company. Some bus companies allow you to book seats in advance; some sell spots based upon availability of seats. Online ticketing are available via some companies too.
Beware buying tickets from bus touts on the street or outside your hotel. The smaller companies are sometimes unlicensed and can cut corners with safety. There have been serious bus crashes involving foreign nationals.

### By taxi

In the cities, taxis are a cheap and convenient way of getting around. Although generally safe, taxis drive as erratically as all the other drivers, especially in Cairo, and there are sometimes fake taxis. Make sure they have official markings on the dashboard or elsewhere; the taxis are always painted in special colours to identify them, as the taxi mark on top of the car. In Cairo, the taxis are all white (rarely with advertisement on sides). These are preferable, as they have a digital counter to tell you how much to pay; you can tell the driver in advance that you will pay only what the meter displays. In Luxor they are blue and white, and in Alexandria yellow and black. In Cairo and Luxor it is often much more interesting to use the taxis and a good guidebook instead of travelling around in a tour bus.
Cairo has a sizeable population of modern metered cabs. In Sharm El Sheikh all airport taxis have meters fitted and they must be used. Generally the best way is to ask at your hotel or someone you know from Egypt for the prices from point-to-point. You could also ask a pedestrian or policemen for the correct price. The best way to hire a taxi is to stand on the side of the road and put out a hand. You will have no trouble attracting a taxi, especially if you are obviously a Westerner. It is generally advisable to take white taxis that use the meter because the black and white taxis usually involve haggling at the end of the ride, some white taxi drivers don't start the meter unless you ask them to, if they say the meter is broken it's better to ask the driver to drop you off before you get far. It's important to have some change with you (a couple of fives and a ten) because some drivers say that they don't have change to drive off with the rest of your money.
If riding a black and white taxi negotiate a price and destination before getting into the car. At the end of the journey, step out of the car and make sure you have everything with you before giving the driver the payment. If the driver shouts, it's probably OK, but if he steps out of the car you almost certainly paid too little. Do not be tempted to give them more because of the economic situation; otherwise, ripping off foreigners will become more common and doing so generally tends to add to inflation. You can also hire taxis for whole days if going on longer excursions such as to Saqqara and Dashur from Cairo. Inside the city they are also more than happy to wait for you (often for a small extra charge, but ask the driver), even if you will be wandering around for a few hours.
Taxi drivers often speak enough English to negotiate price and destination, but only rarely more. Some speak more or less fluently and they will double as guides, announcing important places when you drive by them, but they can be hard to find. The drivers often expect to be paid extra for that; however, do not feel the need to pay for services that you have not asked for. If you find a good English-speaking driver, you may want to ask him for a card or a phone number, because they can often be available at any time and you will have a more reliable travel experience.
A new line of taxis owned by private companies has been introduced in Cairo. They are all clean and air-conditioned. The drivers are formally dressed and can converse in at least one foreign language, usually English. These taxis stand out because of their bright yellow colour. They can be hailed on the street if they are free or hired from one of their stops (including one in Tahrir square in the city centre). These new taxis use current meters which count by the kilometre. In general, they are marginally more expensive than the normal taxis; you can call 16516, two hours in advance, in Cairo to hire a taxi.

### By ride-hailing service
Ride-hailing services — Careem, inDrive and Uber — are available in Cairo, Alexandria and Hurghada, and expanding elsewhere. These provide travellers an easy alternative to taxis as the app translates destinations from English to Arabic, and fares are fixed. They are widely used by Egyptians. If you are paying electronically (credit card, etc.) and finding that no driver will accept your ride, try switching to cash.
It seems that Egyptians have caught up to tourists using the Careem app and are trying to negotiate new prices after accepting the ride  —  use with caution. Even when using Uber the drivers may try to renegotiate the price after you enter. Stay firm, maybe offer a tip and use e.g. Google translate to make your point clear.

### By car
Despite decreasing subsidies, Egypt still has some of the lowest fuel prices in the world: LE15.5—19.0 per litre as of April 2025. If you decide to rent a car, you will not add significantly to the cost through fuel. Car rental sites require you to be at least 21 years old. Driving in Egypt is not for the faint of heart and can be downright dangerous; unless you really need this option it is just as easy and probably cheaper to travel by taxis and around the country by air, train or bus. As you will see shortly after arrival, obedience of traffic laws is low and there are very few signs indicating road rules. Expect to see other vehicles driving against the flow on motorways, no lane discipline and many death defying manoeuvres. It is as if most drivers are very drunk (they are not). You might also become a target for Egyptian police seeking a bribe, who will pick some trivial offence you have committed and which in reality you could not have avoided. Egypt and Cairo in particular have a reputation for the worst driving in the world (it is not the worst, but is still very bad). Most Egyptian roads have unmarked speed humps. These humps are not small and on some major roads can be too large for low clearance vehicles to get over without damage.

### By metro
Three metro lines serve Greater Cairo, see Cairo#Get around. A metro line is under construction in Alexandria (as of 2025).

### By boat
A felucca cruise on the Nile is a popular way to transit Upper Egypt.
The ferry across the Red Sea between Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh was suspended in 2010, and no re-start is in sight.

## See

Highlights of any visit to Egypt include famous archaeological sites from both Lower (North) and Upper (South) Egypt. The most famous are:
Greater Cairo:

Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx
Egyptian Museum
Red, Bent and Black Pyramids of Dahshur, neglected but a great alternative to Giza with the oldest known pyramid
Citadel of Salah El Din and Mosque of Mohamed Ali
Khan al Khalili bazaar and al Hussein Mosque
Pyramids and temples of Saqqara, just north of Dahshur
Memphis, with some relics of ancient Egypt - including a huge statue of Ramesses II, evoking the image which inspired Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem Ozymandias
Alexandria is the country's main summer attraction for Egyptians escaping the summer heat and looking for a place to spend vacation.
The city has several Roman and Greek sights:

the stunning new Bibliotheca Alexandrina
Qa'edbay's Castle
Colonial and Roman buildings
Qasr El Montaza (El Montaza Palace),

Aswan is a great alternative over the hassling and overrated Luxor. Here, you can equally see impressive temples and ancient monuments, but at the same time relax and enjoy the authentic and large souq, and:

Tombs of Nobles, with a great view of Aswan and some fine paintings inside the tombs.
Abu Simbel, near the border with Sudan at Lake Nasser, one of the most impressive sights in Egypt besides the pyramids.
Geziret El Nabatat (The Island of Plants), an island in the Nile River of Aswan which was planted by rare species of plants, trees and flowers.
Perhaps the most popular activity in Luxor and Aswan is to do the Nile Cruise on a ship between both. It enables you to stop at each location along the Nile where you can see all the famous ancient monuments, including the neglected Kom Ombo, as well as experience being in the Nile River inside a five-star hotel boat.
Luxor:

Karnak and Luxor Temples
West Bank with the Valley of the Kings, Medinat Habu and the Temple of Hatshepsut
Also not to miss:

The Red Sea resorts at Sinai peninsula, including Dahab, Hurghada, and Sharm el Sheikh, with some of the best dive locations in the world.
The sights of the Sinai peninsula, including Saint Catherine's Monastery and Mount Sinai.
The western desert and the oases there, including Siwa.

### Spectator sports
Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in Egypt, with the Egyptian Premier League being the main domestic tournament. The Cairo Derby between the clubs of Al Ahly and Zamalek is the main highlight of the season, and widely regarded to be the biggest rivalry in all of Africa. The Egyptian national team is also one of the strongest in Africa, having won the African Cup of Nations a record 7 times, with some of the top Egyptian players having gone on to successful careers in Europe's elite clubs.

## Do
Cairo, for instance has so much to do and see. Besides the ancient Egyptian history, there is the history of Romans, Greeks, Byzantine Empire, Islamic empire, Ottomans, and finally modern Egyptian history.

Jewish and Christian history
To see more about Egypt's Christian and Jewish history, go to a local tourist office and ask them to give you names of local churches and synagogues. There is at least two synagogues dating back many years ago, when Egypt had a population of a few hundred thousand Jews in the country, who eventually left during the formation of Israel in 1948.
There is a lot of old and interesting churches to see in different areas of Cairo, including downtown Cairo, Heliopolis, Korba, Shubra, Abbasiya, Zamalek, and Maadi. Some of these churches have been around for several hundred years and their architecture resemble that of Churches in Western countries, often built by Europeans who built much of the city's architecture in the 19th century as a resemblance to modern buildings of Europe at the time.
Modern Cairo
If you want to see modern Cairo, try walking in the streets of Zamalek, Maadi, Mohandiseen, or Heliopolis where you will see some of the more modern buildings and get to experience the way of life in Egypt.
Local cafés, coffeeshops and restaurants
For social times, try sitting in one of the local cafes restaurants where you can meet and interact with fellow Egyptians. There are numerous coffeeshops/cafes and restaurants all over Cairo all catering for different tastes and backgrounds and range from the very budget to the very expensive.
Local chains include Coffee Roastery, Cilantro, Grand Cafe, and Costa Coffee. Generally each area of Cairo has its cafés and restaurants.
Sporting and recreational clubs:
If the heat is too much, you can go to one of the famous sporting clubs such as the Gezira Club located in Zamalek, or the Seid Club (otherwise known in English as the Shooting Club) located in Mohandiseen, where you can have a dip at the swimming pool or otherwise enjoy sitting in the shade and comfort of lush trees and gardens. Entrance for foreigners can be gained by buying a one-day ticket which enables the person to enjoy all the facilities of club including playing any sports. There are of course changing facilities and restaurants inside the club where one can enjoy a meal or a drink after engaging in any activity.
Nightlife:
If you enjoy nightlife, there is quite a few nightclubs and discos where you can drink and dance to some of the most modern tunes in the west as well as listen to some Arabic music. The music varies from Dance and Trance to Hip Hop, Rap, Techno, as well as Rock and Pop. These clubs are usually located inside five-star hotels or at areas such as Mohandiseen and Zamalek.
Examples include: the Cairo Jazz Club (mohandiseen), Purple (on a boat in Zamalek), Hard Rock Café (inside the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Garden City), and L'Obergine (pub and bar in Zamalek).
Desert adventures:
For other adventures, try going to the Haram District of Cairo, and look for any horse-riding stables. There, you can rent a horse for a few hours and ride, or even ride a camel out in the desert by the pyramids and the Sphinx. The best time to do this is at night when you can see all the stars shining together in the sky and capture the magical feeling of the place. You will be with a local guide riding with you on another horse or camel, or you might even be joined a group of other individuals or groups of friends who enjoy riding horses in the desert by the pyramids like yourself.

Nile boat:
Try renting a Feluca boat (small boat that can carry up to 20 individuals) in the Nile of Cairo. There you can experience the beauty of the Nile and the surround scenery, where you can see the city and its buildings and streets from within the water around. Depending on the weather, you can do this either day or night, but you will need to go to the Giza District and walk along the corniche area of the Nile and ask any of the locals for renting this boat.
Islamic Cairo/Fatimid Cairo:
For those interested in the Islamic architecture and history, try going to Islamic Cairo (el Gamalaya district) or Khan El Khalili. There you will see numerous buildings and some mosques and see how buildings and houses were built in the Islamic Era of Egypt. There is also a Souk or (Bazar) where you can buy lots of different souvenirs and items.
Alexandria:
Since Alexandria was founded in 332/31 BC by Alexander the Great “the pearl of the Mediterranean” has been one of the major sites of Egyptian history. After the death of the Macedonian king the city developed under the Ptolemies into the intellectual and cultural center of the entire Hellenistic world. Great scholars lived and worked in the Museion

## Talk

The national spoken and dominant language is Egyptian Arabic – go for this if you want to be understood and perceived as a respectful visitor. 
The official language of Egypt is Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). There are multiple versions of Arabic, often referred to as "dialects", but effectively different languages, mostly mutually unintelligible. MSA is taught in schools and used in most written and official forms such as TV, newspapers, government speeches, teaching and education, and so is understood by literates, but you won't hear it in everyday speech. So you'd need to learn it to read the Qur'an, or to be a serious scholar of the language, but not for short visits.
Southern cities such as Luxor and Aswan have a dialect of Sa'idi Arabic, akin to the language of Sudan and the Saudi Hejaz, however most people can understand the dominant northern dialect. The Siwi language of the Western Desert and the Bedouin dialect of Sinai isn't even understood by most Egyptians. Egyptology scholars and hobbyists understand the hieroglyphics of the pharaohs, while their modern descendant Coptic is only heard in liturgy.
Arabic is a difficult language for most westerners as the grammar and word-patterns are so different. However if you learn nothing else, grasp a few basic words and courtesies. There is a ping-pong ritual whereby each greeting or salutation has a stock reply, so learn these together. After a couple of exchanges people will switch to English rather than endure your Arabic any longer, even before you concede defeat with betetkallem engelīzi? – "Do you speak English?" (betetkallemi engelīzi? when addressing a female). For instance if you say shokran meaning "thanks" their stock reply comes in English: "Aah but you speak such good Arabic!" You might shrug and say ana sāyeH, bas – "I'm just a tourist" and deprecate your attempts. 
Written Arabic is even harder work, but you should learn the numbers, shown below. What is called "Arabic numbers" are actually western Arabic numerals, and the eastern Arabic-speaking world uses the different eastern numerals. They're easy and instructive to learn, because when you see prices displayed for locals you'll realise with a shock how much extra they're demanding of you.
People in the service sector learn any language that might earn their next payment, and hotel and restaurant staff either have good English or quickly call their colleague who does. Otherwise, fish around for any language that might serve. During the 2010s the Russians and Ukrainians kept visiting Egypt in an era when many westerners stayed away, so those are often understood in the main resorts. People's German, French, Italian, and Spanish might be rusty but they'll soon get it back. Along the Sinai coastal strip, they often know some Hebrew as there are many Israeli visitors. However, while the Greek Marine Club in Alexandria still serves good fish, their Greek is as bad as your Arabic.

## Buy

### Money

The local currency is the Egyptian pound (ISO code: EGP), which is divided into 100 piastres. The currency is often written as LE (short for French livre égyptienne, or by using the pound sign £ with or without additional letters: E£ and £E. In Arabic, the pound is called genē [màSri] / geni [màSri] (جنيه [مصرى]), in turn derived from English "guinea", and piastres (pt) are known as ersh (قرش). Wikivoyage uses the "LE" notation for consistency, but expect to see a variety of notations in shops and other businesses.

Coins: Denominations are 25pt, 50pt and 1 pound (silver ring with yellow center). You won't really need to know the name piastre, as the smallest value in circulation as of 2023 is 25 piastres, and this is almost always called a "quarter pound" (rob` genē ربع جنيه), and the 50 piastres, "half pound" (noSS genē نص جنيه).
Banknotes: The banknote denominations in circulation in Egypt are 25 and 50 piastres; 1, 5, 10 (two versions, in paper and polymer), 20 (two versions, in paper and polymer), 50, 100 and 200 pounds.
In Egypt, the pound sterling is called, genē esterlīni (جنيه استرلينى).
The Egyptian pound was devalued dramatically in 2024 to bring the official rate in line with the black market rate. Prices quoted in Egyptian pounds in travel guides are usually out of date and therefore not reliable. 

#### Money exchange
Banks and exchange offices or anyone who would exchange currencies, would slightly extra charge you for the official exchange rate. Foreign currencies can be exchanged at exchange offices or banks, so there is no need to resort to the dodgy street moneychangers. Many higher-end hotels price in US dollars or euros and will gladly accept them as payment, however often at a bad rate over the Egyptian pounds. Bank hours are Sunday to Thursday, 8:30AM-2PM.
Counterfeit or obsolete notes are not a major problem, but exchanging pounds outside the country can be difficult. Before leaving Egypt, even if travelling to neighbouring countries in the Middle East, convert your currency to euros, British pounds or US dollars. Money changers in other countries will give you 30–50% per Egyptian pound than the rate you will get in Egypt, if they accept Egypt's currency at all. Converting to and from US dollars, euros or British pounds has a relatively small spread, so you will only lose a few per cent.

#### ATMs
You can withdraw local money with a Mastercard or Visa card from many ATMs all over Egypt. ATMs are ubiquitous in the cities and probably the best option. The ATMs in Egypt usually don't have any fees for withdrawing money, just avoid the Euronet ATMs. Letting your home bank do the currency conversion when using ATM, offers the best rate. Although most have ceased operations, some foreign banks still have branches in Egypt. These include HSBC and CIB, as well as several Arab banks.
For getting small bank notes, it's best to type in for example LE350 to withdraw (multiple times). Then you get at least one LE100 and one LE50 banknote each time.

#### Credit cards
Visa and Mastercard credit and debit cards are accepted at many frequented places, but only bigger hotels or restaurants in Cairo and restaurants in tourist areas will readily accept American Express and Diners Club cards as payment. Traveller's cheques can no longer be used.

### Shopping

Egypt is a shopper's paradise, especially if you're interested in Egyptian-themed souvenirs and kitsch. However, there are also a number of high quality goods for sale, often at bargain prices. Some of the most popular purchases include:

Alabaster Alabaster bowls, figures, etc are common throughout Egypt.
Antiques In the sense of old items of relatively recent origin (19th century or later). This should be distinguished from "antiquities", i.e. artifacts from deeper history, the trade in which is illegal in Egypt. However, if you want a chair or typewriter from the 1930s or a dish or a pistol from the 1880s, these are available to the adventurous buyer (though beware counterfeiters).
Carpets and rugs
Cotton goods and clothing Can be bought at Khan El Khalili. Better quality Egyptian cotton clothing can be bought at various chain stores including Mobaco Cottons and Concrete which have many branches throughout the country. The clothes are expensive for Egypt but cheap by Western standards given the quality.
Inlaid goods, such as backgammon boards
Jewellery: On the touristy side, cartouches make a great souvenir. These are metal plates shaped like an elongated oval and have engravings of your name in hieroglyphics. Cheap but good-looking rings and pendants in brass are also common. Fine gold and silver jewelry is also available, often at lower prices than you would find for equivalent workmanship and material weight and quality in the West or much of Asia; however, it can be difficult to identify a good craftsman. (The gold- and silversmiths are incidentally more or less the last skilled craftsmen who have shops at Khan el-Khalili, but by no means is that the only place you can find quality gold and silver items.) A note: The Egyptian market generally prefers gold of a very high purity (22 or 24 carat), so be aware if you prefer lower purities for aesthetic or price reasons.
Kohl powder Real Egyptian kohl eye make-up (eye-liner) can be purchased at many stores for a small price. It is a black powder, about a teaspoon worth, that is generally sold in a small packet or a wood-carved container and it is generally applied liberally with something akin to a fat toothpick/thin chopstick to the inner eyelids and outlining the eye. Very dramatic, and a little goes a very long way Cleopatra would have had her eye make-up applied by laying on the floor and having someone drop a miniature spoonful of the powder into each eye. As the eye teared up, the make-up would distribute nicely around the eyes and trail off at the sides, creating the classic look. However, beware that most of them contain lead sulphide, which is a health concern. Ask for a lead-free kohl (min-gheir ruṣāṣ or khālī min ruṣāṣ).
Lanterns (fanūs; pl. fawanīs) Intricately cut and stamped metal lanterns, often with colourful glass windows, will hold a votive candle in style.
Leather goods
Music
Papyrus (bardi) However, most papyrus you'll see is made of a different type of reed, not "papyrus", which is extremely rare. Know what you are buying, if you care about the difference, and haggle prices accordingly. If in doubt, assume it is inauthentic papyrus you are being offered for sale.
Perfume - Perfumes can be bought at almost every souvenir shop. Make sure that you ask the salesman to prove to you that there is no alcohol mixed with the perfume.
Water-pipes (shīsha)
Spices (tawābel) - can be bought at colourful stalls in most Egyptian markets. Dried herbs and spices are generally of a higher quality than that available in Western supermarkets and are a fifth to a quarter of the price, though the final price will depend on bargaining and local conditions.
When shopping in markets or dealing with street vendors, remember to bargain. This is a part of the salesmanship game that both parties are expected to engage in.
You will also find many western brands all around. There are many malls in Egypt, the most common being Citystars Mall, which is the largest entertainment centre in the Middle East and Africa. You will find all the fast food restaurants you want such as McDonald's, KFC, Hardees, and Pizza Hut, and clothing brands such as Morgan, Calvin Klein, Levi's, Facconable, Givenchy, and Esprit.
In Egypt, prices are often increased for foreigners, so if you see a price on a price tag, it may be wise to learn the local Eastern Arabic numerals:

They are written from left to right. For example, the number (15) would be written as (١٥).
Shopping in Egypt ranges goods and commodities that represent souvenirs of Egypt's ancient as well as modern things. These include items such as small pyramids, obelisks and souvenir statues which can be bought at more tourist areas such as Khan El Khalili and Islamic Cairo.
The modern shopping malls, City Stars, City Centre and Nile City, sell designer brands such as Guess, Calvin Klein, Armani and Hugo Boss.

### Tipping
Egyptians do not tip at restaurants, nor do restaurant owners expect them, though at fancier restaurants a service charge may be added to your bill. Many restaurants in touristy areas will inflate prices for foreigners anyway, and you probably won't even know it unless you notice a printed price or another customer being charged a different price for the same thing.
Tips are mostly a tourist thing. 90% of people who work in the service/hospitality industry try to make their main source of income from living off of tips. You don't have to pay huge tips as often smallest notes are appreciated. However, you do not have to tip if you feel that you haven't received any service or help at all or if you feel that the service was bad. Nobody will ever take offence or be disrespectful if you did not tip them.
Most public toilets are staffed, and visitors are expected to tip the attendant. Some toilet attendants, especially at tourist sites, will dole out toilet paper based on the tip they receive. Foreigners may be especially susceptible to this, and although some locals ask or demand tips, they are often not warranted.
If you ask a stranger for directions, tips are not necessary and may even be considered offensive. Officials in uniform, such as police officers, should not be tipped. Remember that bribery is illegal, but it is likely that nothing will happen to you. Be aware that as a foreign tourist, you are seen by many as easy money and you should not let yourself be pressured into tipping for unnecessary or unrequested "services" like self-appointed tour guides latching on to you.
Some general guidelines:

Restaurants: No tip is needed, though in fancier restaurants a service charge (10-12%) may be added to bills
Taxi drivers: Not necessary, always agreed on the fare in advance. Rounding up a little (e.g. +5–10 LE) is now common.
Tour drivers: LE50–100/day per person
Bathroom attendants: LE3–5 (up to 10 LE at major tourist sites)
Cruises: LE150–200/day, depending on the initial price (divided among all staff on board)
Hotel bellman: LE10–20 for all bags (or roughly 10 LE per bag)
Hotel doorman: LE10–20 for services rendered (such as flagging down taxis)
Site custodians: LE10 if they do something useful, none otherwise

## Eat

Egypt can be a fantastic place to sample a unique range of food: not too spicy and well-flavoured with herbs and aromatic spices like parsley, cilantro, dill, cumin, cinnamon, and cardamom. For a convenient selection of Egyptian cuisine and staple foods try the Felfela chain of restaurants in Cairo. Some visitors complain, however, that these have become almost too tourist-friendly and have abandoned some elements of authenticity. A more affordable and wider-spread alternative is the Arabiata restaurant chain, Arabiata is considered by locals to be the number one destination for Egyptian delicacies as falafel and fūl too.
Beware of any restaurant listed in popular guidebooks and websites. Even if the restaurant was once great, after publication, they will likely create a "special" English menu that includes very high prices.
As in many seaside countries, Egypt is full of fish restaurants and markets so fish and seafood are must-try. Frequently, fish markets have some food stalls nearby where you can point at specific fish species to be cooked. Stalls typically have shared tables, and locals are as frequent there as tourists.
McDonald's has food which you may not find in your home country like the McFalafel and the long-streched Chicken Fillet.

### Hygiene
Be aware that hygiene may not be of the highest standards, depending on the place. The number of tourists that suffer from some kind of parasite or bacterial infection is very high. Despite assurances to the contrary, exercise common sense and bring appropriate medications to deal with problems. "Antinal" (Nifuroxazide), an intestinal antibiotic, is cheap, effective and available in every pharmacy. "Imodium" or similar products are prescription drugs only.
Although Antinal is very effective, sometimes when nothing else is, the elderly should check the brand name with their doctor before relying on it as it contains a high concentration of active ingredient that is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or the British regulatory pharmaceutical body.
People expecting to remain in Egypt for more than 2–3 weeks should be cautious about using Antinal, as it may hinder their ability to acquire immunity to local bacteria and make traveller's diarrhoea a more frequent problem.
Hand sanitizer gel is almost nonexistent in Egypt, so you may want to bring enough from home to last your entire trip.

### Local dishes
Many local foods are vegetarian or vegan compliant, a function of the high cost of meat in Egypt and the influence of Coptic Christianity (whose frequent fast days demand vegan food).

Classic Egyptian dishes: The dish fūl medammes is one of the most common Egyptian dishes; consists of fava beans (fūl) slow-cooked in a copper pot (other types of metal pots don't produce the right type of flavor) that have been partially or entirely mashed. fūl medammes is served with cumin, vegetable oil, optionally with chopped parsley, onion, garlic, lemon juice and hot pepper, and typically eaten with Egyptian (baladi) bread or occasionally Levantine (shāmi) pita.
One should try the classic falāfel which is deep-fried ground fava bean balls (but better known worldwide for the ground chickpea version typically found in other cuisines of the Middle Eastern region) that was believed to be invented by Egyptian Bedouins. Usually served as fast food, or a snack, but also a traditional weekend breakfast for many families. Note that falafel is called ța`meyya in most of the country, including Cairo; "falafel", however, is universally understood, as it is used in some major Egyptian dialects (particularly that of Alexandria), besides being standard in other varieties of Arabic.

Koshari is a famous dish, which is usually a mixture of macaroni, lentils, rice and chickpeas, topped with tomato sauce and fried onions. Very popular amongst the locals and a must try for tourists. The gratinated variation is called Tâgen.
Additionally, hummus, a chickpea based food, also widespread in the Middle East.
kofta (meat balls) and kebab are also popular.
Egyptian cuisine is quite similar to the cuisine of the Middle Eastern countries. Dishes like stuffed vegetables and vine leaves and shawarma sandwiches are common in Egypt and the region.

### Exotic fruits
Egypt is one of the most affordable countries for a European to try variety of fresh-grown exotic fruits. Guava, mango, watermelon and banana are all widely available from fruit stalls, especially in locals-oriented non-tourist marketplaces.

## Drink
See also Stay healthy:Fluids section for hygiene and related info.

### Water
Bottled water is widely available. The local brands (most common being Baraka, Hayat and Siwa) are of the same price as foreign brand options which are also available: Nestle Pure Life, Dasani (bottled by Coca-Cola), and Aquafina (bottled by Pepsi). Evian is less available and is expensive. Before you purchase bottled water, check that the neck ring is still attached to the cap by the breakable threads of plastic, as an occasional scam involves collecting empty water bottles and refilling them with tap water.
It is important not to buy strange brands, as they may not be safe for drinking. In 2013, the Ministry of Health stated there are only 17 licensed brands that are safe to drink. These are: Hayah, Safi, Aqua Siwa, Siwa, Aman Siwa, Organica, Nahl, Aqua Sky, Mineral, Vira, Nestlé, Baraka, Alpha, Aquafina, Tiba, Aqua Delta, Dasani and Aqua Paris.

### Juices and herbal teas

Juices can be widely found in Egypt - àSàb (sugar cane; قصب); liquorice (`erk sūs  عرق سوس); sobya (white juice; سوبيا); tàmr (sweet dates; تمر) and some fresh fruit juices (almost found at same shop which offer all these kind of juices except liquorice may be which you can find another places).
Hibiscus, known locally as karkadē (كركديه) or `ennāb (عناب), is also commonly served as a tea. It is regarded as a specialty of Luxor, but is popular across the country. This tea is usually grouped with juices because, while it can be served hot, it is usually iced and served cold, and most often heavily sweetened. Travellers familiar with the aguas frescas of Latin America would be able to identify it as essentially the same as agua de flor de Jamaica. 
Hibiscus and liquorice should not be consumed excessively as they may not be safe for those suffering low blood pressure or high blood pressure. Hibiscus may lower blood pressure, while liquorice may raise blood pressure.

### Alcoholic drinks
Egypt is a predominantly Muslim nation. However, while observant Muslims respect the haram or prohibited status of alcohol, Egyptian law is secular and alcohol is in general permissible. Egyptians tend to adopt a relaxed and pragmatic view towards alcohol for non-Muslims and foreigners. It is tolerated by the vast majority of Egyptians and consumed by a sizeable number of them, and not just the Christian minority. Places which sell alcoholic beverages require special licence and pay extra taxes to operate. Alcoholic beverages and bottled drinks are readily available throughout the country (especially in larger towns and cities, as well as tourist centres). Public drunkenness (especially the loud and obnoxious variety) is definitely not appreciated, and you may end up sobering up in a police cell. Try to be a good ambassador: if you must get "tipsy", confine it to the hotel or very nearby. It's quite rare to see drunken tourists even in tourist areas. It is illegal to drink alcohol in public and it's advisable not to attempt to drink in streets; however, on the New Year's Eve, many Egyptians in Cairo may be drunk and holding alcoholic beverages in the streets.
The cheapest alcoholic beverage is beer. Common brands are: Stella (not Artois) and Sakkara which are common lager beers in Egypt (approx. 4%), both brewed by Heineken's Egyptian subsidiary, Ahram Beverages Company. Other local brands are available, most with a higher alcohol variant that have claimed levels of 8% or even 10%. Foreign brands made under license in Egypt include Heineken and Meister but are slightly more expensive.
More expensive alcoholic beverages than beer are the carbonated vodka cocktails, with 10% alcohol, specifically ID Double Edge which is popular with people who drink alcohol. There is also an assortment of liquors (generally only found in liquor stores, and generally only found at reasonable prices in liquor stores that primarily cater to Egyptians). Wine is available; however, prices for imported wine tend to be high, if not astronomical, and domestic wines (e.g. Omar Khayyam) are overpriced for their rather low quality.
Do not buy anything you don't know or suspect, as there might be a risk that it may be counterfeit and can be adulterated with methanol (methyl alcohol). Methanol is a poisonous but cheap alcohol usually used as e.g. a cleaning solvent or fuel, but which causes blindness and death if ingested.

### Restrictions on alcohol
Egyptian laws towards alcohol are officially quite liberal compared to most Islamic countries, except for the month of Ramadan when alcohol is strictly forbidden. During Ramadan only holders of foreign passports are allowed to buy alcohol, by Egyptian law. However, the enforcement of this law is by no means consistent. In tourist areas like Luxor, alcohol is sold even during Ramadan, and those who look like foreigners will not be asked to show passports or other documentation.
During Ramadan alcohol is often sold only in Western-style hotels and pubs/restaurants catering especially to foreigners. A few days of the year, as the day of the full moon the month before Ramadan, alcohol is completely banned. Also some hotels and bars catering to foreigners will stop serving alcohol during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan: phone ahead to make sure alcohol is still being served in order to avoid disappointment.

## Sleep
Egypt has a full range of accommodation options, from basic backpacker hostels to five-star resorts. Most major hotel chains are represented in Greater Cairo, Sharm el Sheikh and Luxor, at least. You can reserve most of your accommodation online or contact a local agent who can organise both accommodation and trips.
Walk-in rates give you great discounts over online reservations, e.g. half-price in Aswan. Generally, online reservations are more expensive due to it being used by so many tourists. However, in Egypt most hotels do not have their own website and do not have to commit to the agreement with online reservations sites to offer the same price online as offline. Nevertheless, have a screenshot of the actual online price ready, just in case you encounter a hotel that is willing to overcharge you. In high season, it is best to reserve the first night and haggle for the following night(s). Otherwise, if there is no general shortage of rooms and less than 60% are booked (usually displayed at the top of online reservation sites), then check out an area with many hotels and go there asking around. Hotels will also happily accept you cancelling your existing online reservation in person for a discount. When reserving online, often you have the flat price, with tax and fees added. Generally, you will get at least these taxes and fees as discount (10-15%) when cancelling the reservation in person and/or when bargaining.
Some online hotel sites state that payment is required in Egyptian pounds by law. However, most hotels will accept Egyptian pounds at a mostly fair conversion from the online stated rate.

## Learn
Egypt can provide good options for learning the Arabic language, as well as history.
The American University in Cairo (AUC), [1] is the best school in the country and offers degree, non-degree and summer school study options. Popular courses include Arabic Language and Literature, Islamic Art and Architecture, Arab History and Culture, and, of course, Egyptology.
There are a number of options for learning Arabic in Cairo, including the Arabic Language Institute, Kalimat and International Language Institute.

## Work
Egypt has one of the largest economies in Africa and has a somewhat low (7% as of 2023) unemployment rate; therefore, there are jobs for people with the right skills and connections. 
Egyptian companies tend to operate like families; relationships are taken very seriously and you can expect people to constantly inquire about your health, well-being, your office space, and so on. It is important for non-Egyptians to build good relationships, establish themselves, and demonstrate that they are reliable and dependable; Egyptians usually favour working with familiar and trusted people. 
You should be aware that your Egyptian counterpart will feel obliged to reciprocate any gift, invitation or favour you offer them. Therefore, if they invite you to their home, they will expect you to return the gesture in some way. 
Egyptians generally respond well to public praise and respect those who value them in any way, shape, or form ― a common principle shared with many Arab nations. 
Egyptian companies are hierarchical and there are set expectations for both senior managers and junior employees. Senior managers are generally expected to be decisive and demonstrate leadership qualities, and junior employees are generally expected to follow their superiors at all times.

## Stay safe

Egypt is often labelled as an unsafe country by many foreign governments — a reputation that's not entirely unwarranted — but the average traveller should not be too overly concerned or cautious of their surroundings. 
Travelling in Egypt is, more or less, similar to travelling in Morocco, Jordan, Palestine or Turkey.
Perhaps the biggest safety concern is terrorism. The Sinai Peninsula in particular is a hotspot for terrorist activity. 

### Female travellers
Egyptian men will make compliments to women; do not take offence if they do this to you. Men should not be worried, either; if they do this to your partner or daughter it hopefully won't go any further than that.
Be warned that foreign women often attract the attention of Egyptian men. Being overly friendly to or making direct eye contact with an Egyptian man may cause him to think that you're "into" him. 
Some men may inappropriately touch you. If this ever happens, don't be afraid to create a scene and don't feel the need to be polite; no woman should put up with rotten behaviour like that. Bystanders may come to your aid if prompted. One way to deter harassers: loudly say "haraam aleik" (lit. shame on you) or the simpler phrase "imshi" (lit. go away or get lost).

### Political unrest
Egypt has a long history of political instability. Protests against the government can occur anytime, and they can turn violent. Many believe Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's (the current president) government is much more repressive than that of their previous president, Hosni Mubarak.
There is no such thing as "free-speech" in Egypt; thousands of Egyptians have been arrested for publicising strongly worded opinions about the government in public and on social media. Foreigners are not exempt from prosecution. 
If you plan on staying in the country for long, make it a point to monitor local media often.

### Terrorism
Terrorism is a safety concern, and the country's terrorist groups have an unpleasant record of specifically targeting Western tourists and the places they frequent. However, lately the focus seems more on the minority of Coptic Christians than on tourists. The Egyptian security forces remain on a very high level of alert.

Realistically, the odds of being affected by terrorism are low, and most attacks only succeed in killing Egyptians. Tourist sites are heavily guarded, though the proficiency of Egyptian police leaves a lot to be desired.
You will encounter police checkpoints during most trips into the desert, particularly in Upper Egypt, or you may be escorted by local police.

### Drugs

Cannabis and other narcotics are banned and carry heavy penalties. However, hashish in particular is common, even among Egyptians; it is seen to some extent as a part of Egyptian culture and is generally considered much less objectionable than alcohol. Many Egyptian clerics regard it makruh (permitted but disapproved of) rather than haraam (forbidden). Egyptians who recoil at the idea of drinking alcohol may think nothing of using hashish; it is commonly used on festive occasions in rural areas in some parts of the country and in many Sufi rituals nationwide. The police may use possession of hashish as a pretext for arresting and beating up people, but their targets are typically locals, not tourists, as long as you do not antagonise the security forces or otherwise attract their attention. Still, bringing the stuff in or out of the country, or flying domestically with it, is likely to end badly.
Egypt, like the Gulf States, has clamped down on legal painkillers, even when they're accompanied by a prescription and are for the traveller's own use. Check their embassy website for the current list of what's not allowed. It's unclear how rigorously this will be enforced.

### Traffic
Traffic in Egypt is reckless and dangerous. Pay particular attention when crossing the road.  Be patient and watch how locals cross the street to learn safe strategies.

### Scams and hassle
Scams and hassle are the main concern in Egypt, especially in Luxor. Visitors often complain about being hassled and attempts at scamming. While irritating, most of this is pretty harmless stuff, like attempting to lure you into a local papyrus or perfume shop.
Be aware that many Egyptians who start a conversation with you want your money. Typically, you will be approached by a person speaking fluent English, German or Russian who will strike up a conversation under social pretences. He (and it will always be a he) will then attempt to get you to come along for a cup of tea or similar at his favourite (most-paying) souvenir shop. This could also happen outside museums, etc., where the scammer will try to make you believe the "museum is closed" or similar. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Demand prices for everything, because if you say "I thought it was free" after the fact you are in for a vicious argument.
Hassling, while never dangerous, could also be annoying, especially in the main tourist areas. There is no way to avoid this, but a polite la shukran (no thanks) helps a lot. Apart from that, try to take hassling with a smile. If you let yourself be bugged by everyone trying to sell you something, your holiday won't be a very happy one.
Potentially more annoying are taxi drivers or others getting a commission fee to lead you to their hotel of choice, of course paying commission fees for each guest they receive. Firmly stand your ground on this. If they insist, just ask to be dropped off at a street or landmark close to the place you are heading to. This scam is especially common among taxi drivers from the airport.

### LGBT travellers
The gay scene in Egypt is not open and free like in the West. Gay and lesbian visitors should be self-aware and refrain from overt and public displays. While a few gay bars had been able to operate semi-openly in major cities in pre-revolutionary times, the situation has deteriorated. Gays have been arrested by the police and detained and even tortured for engaging in homosexual activity.
Egypt is an Islamic and conservative country. Any display of homosexuality is considered strange, weird, disrespectful and may lead to hostile reactions. Depending on the situation and the place and time, it could be anything from weird looks to physical abuse. Therefore, gays and lesbians should be discreet while in Egypt.

### Crime
Pick pocketing was a problem in the past in Egypt's bigger cities, particularly Greater Cairo. Many locals therefore opted not to carry wallets at all, instead keeping their money in a clip in their pocket, and tourists would be wise to adopt this as well. On the upside, violent crime is rare, especially for tourists, and you are highly unlikely to be mugged or robbed. If, however, you do find yourself the victim of crime, you may get the support of local pedestrians by shouting "Harami" (Thief) but do not pursue because it's the easiest way to get lost and most criminals carry pocket knives; if the crime happens in a tourist area you'll find a specially designated Tourism Police kiosk. In other information, Drones are strictly prohibited. Bringing a drone into the country without a difficult-to-obtain permit can lead to confiscation or arrest.

### Egyptian dual nationals
If you are a dual citizen of Egypt or considered Egyptian by the authorities, your other passport will not exempt you from mandatory military service (applicable to men only) and grant you consular access and protection in the unlikely event you get detained or arrested by the authorities.

## Stay healthy

### Healthcare
Some of the hospitals in Egypt's major cities and tourist areas are of international standard. Private hospitals are expensive by Western standards, but it is advisable to use private hospitals. Hospitals will not treat patients if travel insurance does not cover the costs or if a large sum of money has not been deposited with the hospital. For this reason, travellers to Egypt are advised to take out comprehensive travel insurance.
Doctors in private hospitals in Egypt have often studied abroad. Adequate primary health care is available, particularly in the Cairo, Alexandria, Hurghada and Sharm el Sheikh areas, but access to more demanding care can be limited in some areas.
Most public hospitals do not accept foreign insurance documents as a guarantee of payment and require cash payment. When you pay for medical treatment yourself, the doctor or hospital will give you a receipt and a statement of treatment. You can send these to your insurance company. You can also get an official receipt from your pharmacy for the medicines you have paid for. These documents will include the doctor's details, a clarification of the name and contact details of the practice and hospital (address, telephone and fax numbers and, in the case of hospitals, website address). However, you should always check this.
Private medical care is available, particularly in Cairo (Anglo American Hospital Zamalek, As Salam International Hospital Maadi, Dar Al Fouad Hospital Sheik Zayed and Saudi-German Hospital Heliopolis) and Alexandria (German Hospital). Doctors almost always speak English (as English has been the language of instruction in Egyptian medical schools since they started in the 19th century); nurses are more hit-and-miss. Private hospitals often accept foreign insurance documents as proof of payment. You should check with the hospital beforehand.
In tourist resorts such as El Gouna and Hurghada, some hotels cooperate with doctors. The hotel can then order a doctor.
The emergency number of the Egyptian ambulance is 123. However, ambulance availability varies from region to region and it can take a long time to reach the patient, especially in heavy traffic. Outside large cities, health services are often inadequate, especially for demanding medical treatments.
Pharmacies in Egypt are generally comprehensive and many medicines are available without a prescription. When buying medicines, make sure that they are clearly labelled in their original packaging. Counterfeits are available in some pharmacies and can be dangerous in the worst case.

### Fluids
Ensure that you drink plenty of water: Egypt has an extremely dry climate most of the year, which is aggravated by high temperatures in the summer end of the year, and countless travellers each year experience the discomforts and dangers of dehydration. A sense of thirst is not enough to indicate danger: carry a water bottle and keep drinking.
Egyptian tap water is generally considered safe by most locals, but will often make travellers ill. It is not recommended for regular drinking, especially to very local differences in quality. Bottled mineral waters are widely available: see Drink:Water section. Beware of the old scam where vendors re-sell bottled water bottles, having refilled with another, perhaps dubious, source. Always check the seal is unbroken before paying or drinking from it, and inform the tourist police if you catch anyone doing this.
Be a little wary with fruit juice, as some sellers may mix it with water. Milk should also be treated carefully as it may not be pasteurized. Try only to buy milk from reputable shops. Hot beverages like tea and coffee should generally be OK, the water having been boiled in preparation, though it pays to be wary of ice as well.

### Sun
In the winter, the sun is generally the mildest, especially in December and is the weakest in northern Egypt. Egypt has a desert climate, which makes clouds almost non-existent in the warmer months, so expect extremely bright sunny days especially from June to August, try to avoid direct sun exposure from 9AM (10AM in the summer) to 3PM (4PM in the summer). Bring good sunglasses and wear good sunscreen, however sunscreen becomes ineffective when the exposed skin sweats. Additionally, wearing a hat can help.

### Schistosomiasis
In order to avoid contracting the rightly dreaded schistosomiasis parasite (also known as bilharzia), a flatworm that burrows through the skin, do not swim in the Nile or venture into any other Egyptian waterways, even if the locals are doing so. It is also a good idea not to walk in bare feet on freshly-watered lawns for the same reason.
Although the disease takes weeks to months to show its head, it's wise to seek medical attention locally if you think you've been exposed, as they are used to diagnosing and treating it, and it will cost you pennies rather than dollars. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain and fatigue, making the disease easy to mistake for (say) the flu or food poisoning, but the flatworm eggs can be identified with a stool test and the disease can usually be cured with a single dose of Praziquantel.

### Vaccinations
The following vaccinations are generally recommended for Egypt:

All routine vaccinations including: measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, polio vaccine and yearly flu vaccine.
Hepatitis A and typhoid fever.
Hepatitis B if a sexual contact, tattooing/piercing or medical procedures are planned.
Rabies if a long stay is planned especially if with outdoor activities.
The World Health Organisation considers Egypt to be malaria free.

### General issues

While Egypt is interesting and beautiful, it is full of stress from noise, dust and people hassling you. Especially when not staying at the high end hotels or completely relying on package tours, this will grind your gears. Thus, from time to time take a break from the constant attraction-seeking, bargain-hunting and trip-organising; choose a slower pace, just spend a day in the ho(s)tel or hang around in a park with your headphones on. Also, do not forget earplugs for the night, because often there will be noise even deep in the night or quite early in the morning if you are near a school. Egypt doesn't seem to rest, but this doesn't mean you can't.
Smoking is allowed virtually everywhere in Egypt, and you will regularly encounter people smoking on the train, in lobbies and at restaurants. While they might sometimes be considerate and sit somewhere away from others, mostly the smoke gets blown in regardless. Unfortunately, there is not much you can do about it.

## Respect
Egyptians, in general, are friendly and welcoming. As is the case in many Muslim-majority countries, Egyptians consider it shameful to not give a guest a warm welcome.
Egyptians, North Africans, and Arabs in the Gulf share a common culture and form the Arab world; therefore, much of what is considered good manners in Arab world is very much applicable to Egypt. 
First-time visitors to the Arab world should keep the following rule in mind: be smart about what you say or do openly. Any action that causes an Egyptian to lose their honour (face) will not be taken positively. 

### Social customs
Never admonish an Egyptian person directly, even if they have done something wrong in your opinion. If you must give feedback, give a mix of both positive and negative feedback.
Religion is a delicate topic of discussion. Always approach religious discussions with sensitivity and respect. Talking about religion from a secular or agnostic point of view may be met with bewilderment. Also, anything hinting at proselytism will not be appreciated.

### Greeting people
See also Egyptian Arabic phrasebook
When you approach any individual or a group of people for the first time, the best thing to say is the local variation of the Islamic form of greeting "es-salāmu-`alēku" which literally means "peace be upon you". This is the most common form of saying "hello" to anybody. It creates a friendliness between you and people you don't know, builds rapport, and helps build respect! It is also considered polite to say this if you approach someone, instead of just asking them for something or speaking to them directly.
Other forms of greeting include "SàbâH el khēr" ("good morning"), "masā' el khēr" ("good evening"), or the more casual "ezzayyak" addressing a male, or "ezzayyek" addressing a female, which means "hello" or "how are you?".
When leaving, you can say the same "es-salāmu-`alēku", or simply "ma`a s-salāma", literally: "with safety" or "with wellness" which is used to mean to say "goodbye". More educated Egyptians will say "bye-bye" derived from the English "goodbye" or "buh-bye" when leaving others.
Smiling: Most people appreciate a smile, and most Egyptians smile when they speak to someone for the first time. People who don't smile while they speak are considered arrogant, rude, aggressive, unfriendly, etc.

### Dress

Egyptians are generally a conservative people and tend to dress conservatively. Although they accommodate foreigners being dressed a lot more skimpily, it is prudent not to dress provocatively, if only to avoid having people stare at you. It is best to wear pants, jeans, long shorts instead of short-shorts as only tourists wear these. In modern nightclubs, restaurants, hotels and bars in Cairo, Alexandria and other tourist destinations you'll find the dress code to be much less restrictive. Official or social functions and smart restaurants usually require more formal wear.
At the Giza Pyramids and other such places during the hot summer months, short sleeve tops and even sleeveless tops are acceptable for women (especially when traveling with a tour group). Though you should carry a scarf or something to cover up more while traveling to/from the tourist destination. Also, it's perfectly acceptable for women to wear sandals during the summer, and you will even see some women with the hijab who have sandals on.
Women should cover their arms and legs if travelling alone, you do not need to cover your hair; many Christian women walk around in Egypt comfortably with their hair uncovered. Though as a foreigner, you may get plenty of attention no matter what you wear, mainly including people staring at you along with some verbal harassment which you can try to ignore. Egyptian women, even those who wear the full hijab, are often subjected to sexual harassment, including cat calls. You may find that completely covering up does not make a huge difference, with regards to harassment, versus wearing a top with shorter sleeves.

#### Mosque etiquette
Do not enter a mosque wearing any type of shoes, sandals, slippers, boots as this is very disrespectful. Always take them off before entering as they carry the dirt from the street, and the mosque (a place of prayer) should be clean. However, you can keep socks on.

===== Etiquette in the presence of people praying =====
Also, avoid walking in front of persons in prayer. The reason is because when people kneel, they kneel to God. If you stand in front of someone while they are praying or kneeling, it is as if they are kneeling to you or worshipping you, a complete taboo and against the basic foundations of Islam. Otherwise, it is quite acceptable for visitors or Christian Egyptians to carry on as normal in the streets or shops that operate during prayer times.

#### Public displays of affection
Like most other countries in the Muslim world, the Middle East, and even some non-Muslim conservative countries, affection should not be displayed in public. Egyptians are conservative and doing things like making out with your girlfriend/boyfriend in public is considered offensive, rude or disrespectful. A public hug is less offensive, especially if greeting a spouse or family member you haven't seen in a while.
You will notice male-to-male kissing on the cheeks when Egyptian men meet their friends, family, or someone they know well: this is not to be confused with homosexuality. Less commonly, some Egyptian men like to walk next to their male friend with their arms attached together like a loop inside another loop. Again, this is not homosexual behaviour.

### Other issues
Do not photograph people without their permission, and in areas frequented by tourists do not be surprised if a tip is requested. Smoking is very common and cigarettes are very cheap in Egypt.
Most Egyptians tend to have a loud voice when they speak, which is common to some other countries in the region. They are not shouting, but you will know the difference.
Take great care if you choose to drink alcohol (see above), especially if you're from countries where heavy drinking is accepted. Even if you are used to it, you can't estimate the effects of the climate, even at night. The best plan is just to abstain or limit yourself to one drink per meal while in Egypt; it will be cheaper too.

### Sensitive issues
Egyptians, like Greeks, Russians, and Turks, take great pride in their country's history and are proud of what their country has given to the world. Praising the country's history or having a positive discussion about it is a quick ticket to getting on someone's good side. 
Gamal Abdul Nasser, the second President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and many others are considered national heroes in Egypt; you should say absolutely nothing that could be perceived as offensive or derogatory regarding him. 
Many Egyptians have a different interpretation concerning ambiguous expressions such as freedom of speech and democracy. It is advisable not to discuss Israel even if tempted; do not speak loudly about it as it may attract unwanted attention, even if you are only talking about it as a travel destination.

## Connect
Egypt has a reasonably modern telephone service including four GSM mobile service providers. The mobile phone providers are Vodafone, Etisalat, We and Orange.
According to OpenSignal all of them are similarly good. Actual 4G download speeds are around 15 MBit/s. Vodafone has the most consistent network quality. If you plan to visit rather remote areas, also Vodafone has the widest 4G coverage. (updated September 2022)
Mobile Internet SIM cards can be bought for around €5/US$5 (Dec 2022) including 10 GB for 1 month at the airport or for around LE130 per 8GB in the city. As of April 2021 a SIM card with 18GB was USD10 at the Hurghada airport.
Roaming services are provided, although you should check with your service provider.
Internet access is easy to find and cheap, and often free. Nowadays, most coffee shops, restaurants, hotel lobbies and other locations now provide free WiFi. Connections can be unsafe and under surveillance, try to use a proxy or VPN for your privacy.

## Cope

### Tourism and locals

The mentality of many Egyptians you will encounter as a tourist is that after driving recklessly, not doing any extra tour stops and stressing you at the sights about the time, the tour driver will still demand a tip from its passengers. In many touristy areas, like Luxor, they show no scruples in getting money out of you. Hence, always be aware when accepting small "favours", as these often come at a hefty price. Of course, this behaviour is largely driven by the state of the economy and the fact the tourism is a big income generator for many Egyptians. Nevertheless, it can greatly spoil your experience of Egypt.
So, it is best to be prepared. Some rules:

Only rely on one person for one service at a time. Do not let your taxi driver, hotel boy, tour guide, etc., organise anything beyond the original agreed service. Otherwise, they will always try to cash in from you.
When accepting a service, clarify what is included and what not, and whether there will be any extra costs beyond the agreed price. Always make them put it writing and give it to you!
Do not let yourself get intimidated. Many hotels, tours, and such can be rated online; this is your trump card, use it and clearly stand your ground.
If you are on a tour and something does not go according to the agreement, speak out to the tour guide in front of the other tour passengers, they might feel the same way and be on your side, which is very likely considering the constant hassling in Egypt.
When organising your own tour with a driver or guide, only pay at the end. This will give you greater control over what you pay for and how much money you part company with.
Despite those points, be patient if in the end you do get scammed - tours will often change hotels last moment, hotels will often prepare one tour itinerary and do another, guides will often take you to their friend's store and taxi drivers will often say one price and settle for another at the end of trip. Being patient but firm will save you from a ruined holiday!
However, once you get out of the touristy environment, people are very friendly and helpful. Nevertheless, getting out of the cycle of hassle is difficult because most things you will want to see and experience are unfortunately touristy.

### Package tours
If you are a reasonably individual traveller, try to avoid package tours or organised trips, even one-day tours. They are overpriced, poor value for money, do not appreciate your needs, have a tight and mostly unbendable schedule, and are very often a door-opener to additional hassle and money-making. Many tours demand additional payments for camels, local guides, boat trips, etc., which are offered along the way—seemingly for a fair price, but mostly your tour guide will cash in, and they are twice the price you would pay without the guide's involvement. Other tours are half travel and half enforced shopping spree, where you are pushed into seeing papyrus or oil shops. If you complain, be prepared for a very angry tour guide. In addition, you are rushed through the sights and history without any time for digestion. While such tours might suit some travellers, other will find them deeply disappointing, annoying and stressful. If you want to experience the real Egypt besides all-inclusive tourism and bus tours, it is better to rent a taxi (with several people or even alone), go by train or just wander around for not so distant attraction. As explained under #Cope, overall Egypt is a safe place to do so.

### Eastern Arabic numbers

Although it will be impossible to learn Arabic for just one or few trips to Egypt, it is wise to know at least the Eastern Arabic numbers. This will spare you a great deal of rip-offs, and you will even be capable of boarding the right carriage of your train.

### Laundry
There are a number of options for washing clothes whilst travelling in Egypt:
By far the easiest, most practical, and not at all expensive, is to arrange for your hotel to have your washing done for you. By prior arrangement, clothes left on the bed or handed in at reception will be returned to you by evening freshly laundered and pressed.
Determined self-helpers can persist with hand-washing or finding one of the many "hole-in-the-wall" laundries where the staff will wash and press your clothes manually; a fascinating process in itself. Just be aware that your clothes will probably smell of cigarette smoke when returned.
Cairo possesses a few basic Western-style laundromats in areas where foreigners and tourists reside, but they are virtually nonexistent elsewhere in the country. Some hotels in tourist towns like Luxor and Dahab offer a washing machine service in a back room, the machines are usually primitive affairs and you'll be left with the task of wringing and ironing your clothes yourself.

### Litter
Unfortunately Egypt is blighted by large amounts of litter. Expect to see piles of plastic rubbish along the sides of roads, in rivers and canals and in any other space where people feel they can discard what they cannot be bothered to dispose of properly. Egypt is a candidate for the dirtiest country in the world. The large amount of litter also means that there can be many flies to bother you.

### Tampons
When packing, it may be useful to consider that tampons are at least very hard to find or maybe not sold at all in Egypt as of 2022.

### Toilets
Most toilets are under-maintained (to put it lightly) - expect no toilet paper rolls and people offering you the "service" of toilet paper at the entry, at times no water to flush with. Especially, but not only, the tourist sites are a "must-do" for you to bring toilet paper, as they are isolated caravans/huts with thousands of people visiting and little hygiene.
In most cases toilet paper shouldn't be flushed because it can block the sewage, it should rather be thrown in provided waste baskets.
Cafés often don't have toilets, sometimes they have only urinals for male users.

## Go next
Cruises to Israel, Cyprus, Lebanon and Turkey are popular.
Egypt also has direct land borders with Israel, Libya and Sudan, but check current security conditions at and near the crossings and in the countries in question before you go.
Egypt participates in the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip and so the border is indefinitely closed.
