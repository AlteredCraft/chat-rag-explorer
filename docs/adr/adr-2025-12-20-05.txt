# ADR: Centralized Logging Configuration

Date: 2025-12-20
Status: Accepted

## Context
The application needs consistent logging across the module and its dependencies, with support for different levels and output targets.

## Decision
We implemented a centralized `logging.py` utility that configures both a root logger (for deps) and a specific module logger (`chat_rag_explorer`). It supports stdout and file logging.

## Consequences
- Granular control over log noise (DEBUG for app, INFO for deps).
- Persistent log files for debugging.
- Easy to configure via environment variables.
