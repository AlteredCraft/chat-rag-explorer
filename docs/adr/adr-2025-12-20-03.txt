# ADR: OpenRouter as LLM Provider

Date: 2025-12-20
Status: Accepted

## Context
The application needs access to various LLM models without managing individual API integrations for each provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

## Decision
We chose OpenRouter as the unified API gateway.

## Consequences
- Access to hundreds of models via a single OpenAI-compatible SDK.
- Simplified configuration (one API key).
- Flexibility to switch models via configuration.
