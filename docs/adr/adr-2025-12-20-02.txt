# ADR: Modular Flask Structure

Date: 2025-12-20
Status: Accepted

## Context
A monolithic `main.py` is difficult to maintain as the project grows. We need a way to organize logic, routes, and configuration.

## Decision
We implemented a modular structure using the Application Factory pattern (`create_app`) and Flask Blueprints. The main package is named `chat_rag_explorer`.

## Consequences
- Improved testability and scalability.
- Separation of concerns (routes vs. services).
- Clear runtime module identification.
