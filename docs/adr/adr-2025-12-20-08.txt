# ADR: Client-Side Conversation History Management

Date: 2025-12-20
Status: Accepted

## Context
The application needs to maintain conversation context so that the LLM can remember previous interactions in a session. We need a way to store and transmit this history.

## Decision
We chose to maintain the conversation history on the **client-side** (browser) using a JavaScript array. 
- The array is initialized with a system message.
- Every user input and bot response is appended to this array.
- The entire array is sent to the backend `/api/chat` endpoint on every request.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Server-side Session Storage**: Would require a session management system (cookies/redis) and would increase backend complexity for an educational prototype.
- **Database Persistence**: Overkill for a simple explorer, though planned for future roadmaps.

## Consequences
- **Context memory**: The LLM now has full access to the conversation thread.
- **Client-side state**: Refreshing the page clears the conversation history (expected for this prototype).
- **Payload size**: The request size grows with the conversation length. For an educational app, this is acceptable.
- **Simplified Backend**: The backend remains stateless, simply proxying the provided message list to OpenRouter.
