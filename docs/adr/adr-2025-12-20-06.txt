# ADR: Secure Offline Markdown Rendering

Date: 2025-12-20
Status: Accepted

## Context
LLMs often output Markdown. We need to render this as rich HTML while maintaining security and allowing for offline usage.

## Decision
We integrated `Marked.js` for parsing and `DOMPurify` for sanitization. Libraries are stored locally in the `static/` directory.

## Consequences
- Rich UI (bold, lists, code blocks).
- Protection against XSS attacks from LLM output.
- No dependency on external CDNs at runtime.
